</section><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="what-are-call-options">What are call options?</h2><p>Call options are a type of financial derivative that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a stock or another asset at a specific price (called the &ldquo;strike price&rdquo;) within a certain period. Call options are popular among investors who believe the price of a stock will increase, allowing them to buy it at a lower price and potentially make a profit.</p><p>Because the value of a call option is derived from another security, they fall in the category of financial products known as derivatives.</p><p>When you purchase a call option, you are essentially securing the ability to purchase the asset at a later date (known as the expiration date) at a set price (called the strike price). This is an options strategy to have the ability to buy at a predetermined price when buyers expect a rise in the asset price.</p><p>If the asset price at expiration surpasses the strike price, the option is considered in the money and has intrinsic value, which is the difference between the asset&rsquo;s current price and the strike price. If the asset&rsquo;s price remains below the strike price or doesn&rsquo;t rise significantly, the option is considered out of the money and lacks intrinsic value.</p>

It is the cost of the option, which is influenced by various factors such as the current market price of the asset, the strike price, the time to expiration, <a href="https://public.com/learn/market-volatility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market volatility</a>, and interest rates.</p><p>In the US, options exchanges such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Options Clearing Corporation are responsible for call options trading. Options traders can use standardized call options trading on different assets such as stocks, indices, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Individual investors, institutional investors, and hedge funds can all invest in call options.</p><h2 id="key-components-of-a-call-option">Key components of a call option&nbsp;</h2><p>Before diving into how call options work, it&rsquo;s essential to understand the key components:</p><h3 id="1-underlying-asset">1. Underlying asset:</h3><p>This is the security or stock that the call option is based on. Commonly, call options are written on individual stocks, but they can also be tied to ETFs, commodities, or indexes.</p><h3 id="2-strike-price">2. Strike price:</h3><p>The price at which the buyer of the call option can purchase the underlying asset. This price is predetermined when the option contract is created.</p><h3 id="3-expiration-date">3. Expiration date:</h3><p>The call option has a set period during which it can be exercised. After the expiration date, the option becomes worthless.</p><h3 id="4-premium">4. Premium:</h3><p>This is the price paid by the buyer to the seller (also called the option writer) for the rights conveyed by the option. It&rsquo;s essentially the cost of entering into the option contract.</p><h3 id="5-contract-size">5. Contract size:</h3><p>In most cases, each options contract controls 100 shares of the underlying asset.</p><h2 id="how-do-call-options-work">How do call options work?</h2><p>To understand call options, let&rsquo;s break down their core components:</p><ul>
<li><b>Strike price</b>: This is the price at which the holder of the option can buy the underlying asset, such as a stock. If the market price of the asset rises above the strike price, the call option holder can purchase it at a discount.</li>
<li><b>Premium</b>: The premium is the cost to purchase the call option. It&rsquo;s essentially the price paid to obtain the right to buy the stock at the strike price in the future.<br>
</li>
<li><b>Expiration date</b>: Call options have a set expiration date. If the option is not exercised before this date, it expires and becomes worthless, meaning the investor loses the premium they paid.</li>
<li><b>Underlying asset</b>: This is the stock or asset the option is based on. For example, an investor might purchase a call option on shares of a well-known company betting that the stock price may rise.<br>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="examples-of-call-option">Examples of call option</h2><h3 id="example-1">Example 1:&nbsp;</h3><p>Suppose XYZ company is trading at $110 at expiration, and the strike price for a call option contract (which represents 100 shares) is $100. The option cost the buyer $2 per share. To calculate the profit:</p><p><strong>Profit</strong> = $110 &ndash; ($100 + $2) = $8 per share.</p><p>If the buyer purchased one options contract, their total profit would be $800 ($8 per share &times; 100 shares). If they bought two contracts, their profit would be $1,600 ($8 per share &times; 200 shares).</p><p>However, if XYZ company is trading below $100 at expiration, the buyer won&rsquo;t exercise the option, as it wouldn&rsquo;t be beneficial to buy the shares at $100 each. In this case, the option expires worthless, and the buyer loses the $2 per share premium or $200 for each contract purchased. The beauty of buying the call options is that the maximum loss is limited to the premium paid.</p><h3 id="example-2">Example 2:&nbsp;</h3><p>Now, consider that you own 100 shares of XYZ company, which are currently trading at $108 per share, and you want to generate extra income on top of the stock&rsquo;s dividend. You believe the share price won&rsquo;t rise above $115 in the next month.</p><p>You check the call options and find a $115 call trading at $0.37 per contract. By selling one call option, you collect a $37 premium ($0.37 &times; 100 shares), which represents approximately a 4% annualized income.</p><p>If the stock price rises above $115, the option buyer will exercise the call, and you&rsquo;ll be required to sell your 100 shares at $115 per share. You&rsquo;ll still make a profit of $7 per share, but you&rsquo;ll miss out on any additional gains above $115. If the stock remains below $115, you keep both the shares and the $37 premium income.</p>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="how-to-purchase-call-options">How to purchase call options?</h2><p>A call option works by hedging your investment in favor of increasing asset prices. It provides you an option to buy the asset at a predetermined price without an obligation to do so.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how a call option works in simple steps:</p><p><b>Step 1:</b> Purchase the call option for a specific asset.</p><p><b>Step 2: </b>Pay a premium to the option seller, also called the option writer.</p><p><b>Step 3: </b>Gain the right but not the obligation to exercise the option.</p><p><b>Step 4:</b> If the asset&rsquo;s price surpasses the strike price before the <a href="options-expiration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">option expires</a>, exercise the option to buy the asset at the predetermined price. You profit by being able to purchase the asset at a lower price than its <a href="market-value.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market value</a>.</p><p><b>Step 5: </b>If the asset&rsquo;s price fails to exceed the strike price or you choose not to exercise the option, let it expire. In this case, you do not make a profit and lose the premium paid.</p>

That means you can buy company X&rsquo;s shares at the strike price of $110 strike price even though they&rsquo;re worth $120 in the market.<br>
Your profit from this options trade is $120 &ndash; $110 &ndash; $5 (premium) = $5 per share.</p><p><strong>Scenario 2</strong>: The stock price goes down: If the stock price drops below the strike price of $110, you don&rsquo;t have to exercise the option. In this case, you&rsquo;re not obligated to buy the shares, but you lose the $5 premium per share you paid for the call option.</p>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="long-vs-short-call-options">Long vs. Short call options&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Call options are essentially an agreement between a buyer and a seller. They are viable only when the two have opposite expectations about the direction in which the price of an asset will move over a given period. That is the fundamental difference between a &lsquo;long call&rsquo; and a &lsquo;short call&rsquo; in options trading.</p><h3 id="long-call">Long call:&nbsp;</h3><p>A long call represents a buyer&rsquo;s bullish approach to the price of a security. It is bought assuming the asset&rsquo;s price will rise beyond the strike price. The buyer then makes a profit by buying an asset at a price lower than its current <a href="market-value.html">market value</a>.</p><p>The most significant risk with long call options is the potential to lose the entire amount invested. If the price of the underlying asset does not exceed the strike price by the expiration date, the option will expire worthless.</p><h3 id="short-call">Short call:&nbsp;</h3><p>A short call reflects a seller&rsquo;s bullish sentiment regarding the price of an asset. It&rsquo;s based on the expectation that the asset&rsquo;s price will fall below the strike price by the expiration date. The seller then makes a profit from the premium paid by the buyer while also getting to keep the stocks they declined to buy.</p><p>The primary risk of a short call option is potentially unlimited losses. If the price of the underlying asset rises above the strike price, the option seller is obliged to deliver the shares at the strike price, no matter how high the market price of the asset may be.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you purchase a call option on the stock of Company A at the strike price of $50. The current market price of the stock is $55, while the premium you pay for the option is $3 per share.</p>
<p>If the stock price rises to $60 before the option expires, you can exercise the option and buy the stock at the strike price of $50. By selling the stock at the market price of $60, you make a profit of $10 per share.</p>
<p>To calculate the overall profit, you deduct the option premium ($3) and any transaction costs from the profit per share. If, for instance, the transaction costs are $1 per share, your net profit would be $6 ($10 &ndash; $3 &ndash; $1) per share.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the stock price does not reach the strike price of $50 before the option expires, the call option will not be exercised, and you would incur a loss equal to the premium paid, which in this case would be $3 per share.</p>

Using covered calls for additional income</h3><p>In the <a href="https://public.com/trade-options/resources/covered-call" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered calls</a> options strategy, investors already own shares of stock (typically 100 shares per option contract), and they can sell call options against those shares. Premiums from the option buyers may become income for investors. If the stock price remains below the strike price, the options expire, and investors retain both the premium and shares.&nbsp;</p><p>This strategy may generate a steady income while maintaining ownership of underlying assets. The challenge with this strategy is that the covered call writer might miss out on potential stock gains beyond the strike price if the option gets exercised.</p><h3 id="2-using-calls-for-speculation">2. Using calls for speculation</h3><p>Call options can act as a speculative tool when investors&rsquo; <a href="10-options-strategies-for-investors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">options trading strategy</a> is to limit risk even when they have a bullish market view. Call options offer an opportunity to buy options at a fraction of asset&rsquo;s cost, without purchasing the asset directly. If the asset&rsquo;s price rises above strike price, investors may gain substantially at a relatively lower initial price.</p><h3 id="3-hedging">3. Hedging</h3><p>Call options may also be used as a hedging tool to protect against the risk of missing out on potential gains. For example, if an investor is holding cash but anticipates a rise in a particular stock&rsquo;s price, they may buy a call option as a way to hedge against the possibility of the stock rising. This may allow them to lock in the right to buy at a specific price in the future, without committing to purchasing the stock immediately.</p><h3 id="4-leverage">4. Leverage</h3><p>You can control more shares with less upfront capital by using call options. This may let you amplify your potential gains with a smaller investment.</p><h3 id="5-risk-management">5. Risk Management</h3><p>You can use call options to limit losses on other investments. If you have a short position, buying a call option may help you protect against unexpected price increases.</p><p>By incorporating call options into your investment portfolio, you may gain the flexibility to manage risk, generate income, or take advantage of market opportunities.</p><h2 id="why-buy-a-call-option">Why buy a call option?</h2><p>Investors may generally buy call options when they are optimistic about the financial market. Here are the primary scenarios where investors generally consider buying:</p><ul>
<li>Anticipation of a rise in stock prices.</li>
<li>Wish to limit downside risk.</li>
<li>Potential to capitalize on short-term share price fluctuations.</li>
<li>Exposure to a particular industry without needing to buy individual stocks.</li>
</ul><h2 id="why-sell-a-call-option">Why sell a call option?</h2><p>Selling a call option may be a strategic choice when investors have a neutral to bullish market position. If you exercise an option, you must sell the underlying asset at the strike price.</p><p>Here are the key circumstances where investors consider selling:</p><ul>
<li>Anticipation of stock prices to remain the same or go down.</li>
<li>An objective of generating a steady income.</li>
<li>An objective of hedging against an existing long stock position to offset potential losses in the stock price decreases.</li>
<li>An intent of reducing position in a particular stock, sector, or industry and lock in potential gains.</li>

	<p>Options are not suitable for all investors and carry significant risk. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. There are additional costs associated with option strategies that call for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads, straddles, among others, as compared with a single option trade. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must read the “Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, also known as the options disclosure document (ODD) which can be found at: www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document.</p>

<b>All investments</b> involve the risk of loss and the past performance of a security or a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.

<b>PUBLIC ADVISORS LLC</b></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investment advisory services for Treasury Accounts are provided by Public Advisors LLC (“Public Advisors”), an SEC-registered investment adviser.  Brokerage services are provided by Public Investing (see below).  Public Advisors and Public Investing are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”), and both subsidiaries charge a fee for their respective Treasury Account services.  Before investing, consider your investment objectives, all fees and expenses, and any potential conflicts of interest.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/public-customer-relationship-summary">Form CRS</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>, and other disclosures.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections are provided for informational and illustrative purposes, and may not reflect actual future performance.</p>
<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>.</p>

<b>OPEN TO THE PUBLIC INVESTING, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Securities, Options, and Bonds.</b></p>
<p>Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds (except for Treasuries offered through your Jiko Account) are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.  Additional information about Public Investing can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered.  Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured.  Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits. Additional information about SIPC can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.  Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Margin-Disclosure-Statement-2024.09.19.pdf">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Apex-Margin-and-Short-Account-Agreement.pdf">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-ira">Individual Retirement Accounts</b><br />
Self-directed individual retirement accounts are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Information about retirement accounts on Public is for educational purposes only and is not tax or investment advice. Consult your tax advisor for individual considerations. Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="../disclosures/Open-to-the-Public-Investing-Inc.-Fixed-Income-Disclosure.pdf">fixed income</a> and <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Apex-Fractional-Bond-Disclosure-1.pdf">fractional bonds</a>.

<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> to learn more. </p>
<p>
<b>Fractional Shares</b><br />

<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
