</ol><p>Investing in the stock market offers a way to grow your money over time as you live your life, with the goal being that you will reap the rewards in the future. Still, when it comes to learning how to invest in the stock market, there can be a lot of confusion, especially for beginners.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll come across some interesting terms along the way, and as you learn, your understanding will grow naturally. So, don&rsquo;t worry if you&rsquo;re not familiar with terms such as <a href="bear-markets.html">bear markets</a> and <a href="bull-vs-bear.html">bull vs. bear</a> just yet. Like most things, there is a learning curve, so spending a little time researching will be worth the effort.</p><p>When it comes to investing, there are both risks and rewards, but like anything else, just getting familiar with the basics of investing in stocks can provide a good jumping-off point, reducing some of those risks. Today, with so many options available and the ability to do it yourself, there is no reason to wait.</p><p>Despite the myth that investing is only for the super wealthy, it isn&rsquo;t. It just takes some time and a little money. For many of us, when we think about investing in the stock market, a variety of things may come to mind. Most will be scenes from movies that depict the frenzied stock market floor or heavy hitters getting filthy rich off one stock. The reality of how to play the stock market is very different.</p><p>Think about it this way, when you buy stock, you&rsquo;re buying a small piece of a company with hopes that it will gain value over time, providing you with a healthy financial future.</p><p>As a DIY investor, you have a lot of choices, and there are some definite steps you can take to make the most of your money, and you can do it all as a novice. Researching the stock market is an excellent place to start.</p><p>Although the DIY route is for those who want total control over their investment options, this doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to go it alone. There is a wealth of information available so you can get up to speed quickly and feel confident in making decisions. The benefit is that it allows you to choose low-cost investments and maintain control over those choices and your costs.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-invest-in-stocks">How Do I Invest in Stocks?</h2><p>Although the world of finance is filled with financial gurus who seem to complicate the ideas and concepts surrounding the stock market and how to invest, don&rsquo;t let it intimidate you. All it comes down to is putting your money in companies that are financially stable and monitoring them as necessary.</p><p>That being said, nothing beats being an educated investor, so before you start investing in stocks, let&rsquo;s get familiar with the concept of the stock market and <a href="how-do-stocks-work.html">how stocks work</a>.</p><p>When you hear people discuss the stock market, they are most likely referring to what is known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 (S&amp;P500), which are the major indexes that show how the various companies that make up the stock market perform. However, as an investor, it&rsquo;s essential to understand that the stock market is a place where regular people can buy and sell stocks, which, as we now know, are fractional pieces of the companies we buy ownership into.</p><p>Some of the terms to be familiar with include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Asset</strong> &mdash; the term used to describe anything that has monetary value. In the stock market, that would include stocks, bonds, and cash reserves which you can use to buy and sell in the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://public.com/learn/what-is-asset-allocation"><strong>Asset allocation</strong></a> &mdash; an investment strategy that takes into consideration some vital information such as age, risk tolerance, and investment goals to offer a well-balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other investments to help you to reach your investment goals.</li>
<li><strong>Stocks</strong> &mdash; what companies issue to investors to grow their business by raising money. Investors purchase stocks to grow their money and get ahead of inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Bonds</strong> &mdash; one of three main investment assets used to invest in the stock market. They are loans to companies that provide a fixed rate of return to investors over time.</li>
<li><a href="what-is-an-etf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ETFs</strong></a> &mdash; otherwise known as exchange-traded funds &ndash; are funds that can be traded as a group or bucket of assets, similar to how stocks are traded in the stock market.</li>
<li><strong>Yield</strong> &mdash; the annual rate of return of a bond or other financial assets.</li>
<li><strong>Bear market</strong> &mdash; when stock prices fall by 20% or more over a two-month period of time.</li>
<li><strong>Bull market</strong> &mdash; when stock prices rise 20% or more for at least a two-month period of time.</li>
<li><strong>IRA</strong> &mdash; an individual retirement account that allows a tax advantage in saving for retirement.</li>
<li><strong>A broker</strong> &mdash; also called a stockbroker &ndash; is a licensed person or investing company allowed to buy and sell through stock market exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>Financial planner</strong> &mdash; helps individuals to manage their money. They offer advice on retirement planning, investing, and monitoring their client&rsquo;s financial life. They can be professionals or what is known as Robo-advisors, which are digital investment managers that can be utilized for assistance in making investments through your brokerage account as a DIY investor.</li>
<li><strong>Robo-Investor</strong> &mdash; an automated service that uses computer advanced software and algorithms to suggest and build investment portfolios online through a brokerage account.</li>
<li><strong>CFP</strong> &mdash; or certified financial planners &ndash; go through a rigorous certification process and must adhere to a strict ethical standard of practice and fiduciary standard that obligates them to create a financial plan with their client&rsquo;s best interest in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Fiduciary</strong> &mdash; is a person or organization obligated to their client&rsquo;s best interests and must invest in only those investments that suit their client&rsquo;s goals. They are held to a high standard of trust, putting their clients first in order to avoid any conflicts of interest.</li>
<li><strong>Passive investing</strong> &mdash; is a hands-off approach that may utilize a Robo-investor to choose investments through algorithms with no human interaction. It focuses on long-term investment goals that require little monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Fund</strong> &mdash; is money that is saved for a specific purpose. In investment terms, an example is mutual funds, which allow shareholders to invest in a portfolio of a variety of stocks and bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Mutual fund</strong> &mdash; a company that pools the money from investors and uses it to invest in securities such as stocks, bonds and short-term investments.</li>
<li><a href="what-is-an-index-fund.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Index fund</strong></a> &mdash; a category of mutual funds that attempts to perform the same way the S&amp;P 500 index would.</li>
<li><strong>Market index</strong> &mdash; is a grouping of investments such as the S&amp;P 500, which is made up of five-hundred stocks from the biggest companies in the US.</li>
<li><a href="https://public.com/learn/diversification-and-why-it-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diversification</strong></a> &mdash; reduces your stock market investment risk by spreading your investments over a wide range of assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and cash reserves. Diversifying allows you to reduce your risk by not putting all your eggs in one basket.</li>
<li><strong>Compound interest</strong> &mdash; the interest earned on both the original deposit amount and the interest that that original amount earns. It&rsquo;s one of the most powerful concepts in stock market investments.</li>
</ul><p>Although these are just a few of the terms you&rsquo;ll come across in your journey on how to get into the stock market, you will find them helpful in gaining an overall understanding that will come in handy as you continue to learn.</p><h3 id="steps-to-start-investing-in-stocks">Steps to Start Investing in Stocks</h3><p>For those who have not had experience in how to invest in the stock market, the process can feel overwhelming, so you&rsquo;re going to want a guide. The steps aren&rsquo;t difficult, so take them one at a time and learn everything you can along the way.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the stock market does have fluctuations, so seek investment advice if you need it. There are no guarantees when it comes to how to invest in stocks but considering a few things can offer insights on how to play the stock market in a way that is comfortable for you. You&rsquo;ll want to:</p><ol>
<li>Determine your investment goals</li>
<li>Decide where you will invest and the tools you will utilize</li>
<li>Choose an investment strategy</li>
<li>Confirm your investment budget</li>
<li>Set up an Investment account</li>
<li>Choose stocks</li>
<li>Track your investments&rsquo; progress</li>
</ol><h2 id="step-1-determine-your-investing-goals">Step 1: Determine Your Investing Goals</h2><p>Having stock market investment goals will help you decide where to invest and how to allocate those investments. You&rsquo;ll want to identify tangible goals and allow time to make them a reality. They may include things like a plan to invest for retirement, setting up a college fund, or starting or expanding a business. Deciding what your goals are will help to clarify how to get started in stocks and set yourself up to achieve those targets.</p><h2 id="step-2-decide-where-to-invest-in-stocks">Step 2: Decide Where to Invest in Stocks</h2><p>To determine the best way to invest in stocks, you have to first figure out what you&rsquo;re comfortable with. There are a few ways to go about it, including:</p><ul>
<li>A DIY approach where you&rsquo;ll invest on your own</li>
</ul><p>When it comes to DIY investing, there are so many options available. The big brokerage companies usually have a DIY option. Still, there are some great apps available as well, such as <a href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Public app</a>, which is a commission free option.</p><p>Whoever you invest with, you&rsquo;ll want to check if any fees may be associated with the account. Most are low, making this the most cost-effective option. Although this is considered doing it yourself, remember that they all come with plenty of information that will be helpful.</p><ul>
<li>Investing in your employer&rsquo;s 401K plan</li>
</ul><p>This is one of the easiest ways to learn where to invest in stocks and teaches the basics in an easy-to-understand way. 401Ks usually don&rsquo;t offer individual stocks but have diverse options such as mutual funds. When it comes to investing, the most proven methods can be summarized into doing just three things: Investing small amounts regularly, such as a percentage of your income from each paycheck, having a hands-off approach, and thinking long term.</p><ul>
<li>Investing through a full-service firm with an advisor.</li>
</ul><p>If you&rsquo;ve decided that having your investments handled for you is your best option, an advisor could be a good option. They can help you identify your goals, put a plan together for you, and choose the investments that will help you reach those goals.</p><p>They can help you to avoid decisions that may steer you away from your financial goals and keep you on track over the long term providing sound advice along the way.</p><p>There is no best option when it comes to where to invest in stocks, only the best option for you and your investing personality. However, each of these can offer easy options when it comes to reaching your goal.</p><h2 id="step-3-pick-your-investing-strategy">Step 3: Pick Your Investing Strategy</h2><p>Picking your investment strategy is an important step in how to invest money in stocks. The decisions you make will help to guide you through the process and give you the structure to stay with it over the long term.</p><p>Some <strong><a href="https://public.com/learn/investing-strategies-intro-to-investing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investment strategies</a></strong> include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Passive strategy</strong> &mdash; when you buy and hold for the long term.</li>
<li><strong>Active strategy</strong> &mdash; when you buy and sell frequently, always trying to outperform the market.</li>
<li><strong>Growth investing</strong> &mdash; evaluating companies that have a growth track record over time and putting a portfolio together of about ten of those companies.</li>
<li><strong>Value investing</strong> &mdash; when you look for bargain stocks that may lead you to index or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</li>
</ul><h3 id="best-ways-to-invest-in-stocks">Best Ways to Invest in Stocks</h3><p>Investing offers a variety of opportunities and ways to learn how to play the stock market; you just need to know what they are. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution, evaluating your investing style can assist you in making the right choices for you.</p><p>Your investment options can include one or all of the following:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Individual stocks</strong> &mdash; are purchased in what is called shares. Buying one or more shares means you own a piece of that company. There are two ways to make money with stocks that include price appreciation and dividends that allow for unlimited growth potential.</li>
<li><a href="what-are-equities.html"><strong>Equities</strong></a> &mdash; money that is invested in a company by purchasing in the stock market.</li>
<li><strong>Index funds</strong> &mdash; are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds that make up a portfolio that matches parts of financial markets like the Standard and Poor&rsquo;s 500 index (S&amp;P500) that offers a diversity of investments.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange-traded Funds (EFTs)</strong> &mdash; are traded on the stock exchange the same way stocks are traded, with prices fluctuating throughout the day.</li>
<li><strong>Mutual funds</strong> &mdash; are not traded on the stock exchange. They are traded only once after the stock market closes for the day.</li>
</ul><p>Another term to know is called a call option, which is a financial contract that allows a buyer to purchase investments at a specific cost for a specified amount of time.</p><h2 id="step-4-determine-your-investment-budget">Step 4: Determine Your Investment Budget</h2><p>When it comes to figuring out how to <a href="https://public.com/learn/how-to-start-investing-with-100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invest money in stocks</a>, you want to first determine how much you can afford to invest. There are several things to consider that include:</p><ul>
<li>How much disposable income you have available. This is money that you don&rsquo;t need to pay all your bills and day-to-day expenses.</li>
<li>Your age. When you&rsquo;re younger, you have more time to save for retirement, allowing you to invest small amounts of money on a regular basis. If you&rsquo;ve started investing late, you&rsquo;ll need to invest more money to meet your needs as you get closer to retirement.</li>
<li>Your risk tolerance. In general, the rule is that the younger you are, the more risk you can take. But that doesn&rsquo;t really say anything about you and what your comfort level is. If you aren&rsquo;t comfortable with or stress out about your investments, choosing a less risky option for the long term can help you to sleep better at night.</li>
<li>Your financial goals. Knowing your end game can help in making choices about your investment budget. <a href="how-long-will-my-retirement-savings-last.html">Saving for retirement</a> is different from a short-term goal of saving for a house, so having concrete goals will help to determine your budget.</li>
</ul><h2 id="step-5-open-an-investment-account">Step 5: Open an Investment Account</h2><p>So, now you&rsquo;ve learned about the stock market, how to invest to suit your investment personality, and you&rsquo;re ready to jump in. There are a lot of choices when choosing an investment account, and for anyone looking for DIY options, simpler is better.</p><ul>
<li>Investment apps have gained popularity due to the ease of getting started and the ability to check on investments and make trades on the go. Access to investment advice and the simplicity make investing a breeze.</li>
<li>Traditional brokerage accounts offer a full-service option at a price. Depending on the type of account you open, it may be taxable, so do your homework when choosing this route.</li>
<li>Employers&rsquo; 401K &ndash; is easy and offers a percentage of each paycheck to be invested regularly.</li>
</ul><p>Opening an account is easy as 1-2-3</p><p>Once you have decided on goals, risk tolerance, available income, and have determined what type of account you want to open, it&rsquo;s time to fill out an application!</p><ol>
<li>All you&rsquo;ll need is some basic information along with your social security number and driver&rsquo;s license number.</li>
<li>Fund the account by transferring money from your bank account.</li>
<li>Research investments.</li>
<li>Give it time.</li>
</ol><h2 id="step-6-choose-the-right-stocks-for-you">Step 6: Choose the Right Stocks for You</h2><p>Only you can decide what types of investments are a good fit for you, but it&rsquo;s worth looking into some of the most <a href="../themes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular themes</a> to see if you find anything interesting. Since we&rsquo;ve covered how to get into stocks and you&rsquo;ve evaluated the essential aspects of your investment personality, it&rsquo;s time to research and dive into the stock market as an investor.</p><p>As we talked about, <a href="how-to-diversify-a-stock-market-portfolio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diversification</a> is a way to have a well-rounded portfolio that can help you reach your financial goals. Adjusting your goals annually can help you to stay on track over the long haul.</p><h2 id="step-7-track-your-progress">Step 7: Track Your Progress</h2><p>In order to know how your investments are doing, you&rsquo;ll need to track them over time. Most likely, your brokerage account has tracking and graphs, but you can also use other methods as well, such as:</p><ul>
<li>Online tracking with Robo investors and apps.</li>
<li>Personal finance software such as Quicken.</li>
<li>DIY spreadsheets such as Excel</li>
</ul><p>The way you track your investments can also depend on the choices you&rsquo;ve made, and again, that will depend on what works for you. When you use investing apps, such as <a href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Public app</a>, you can simplify the process and your investments are just a click away.</p><h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul>

<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.

<b>OPEN TO THE PUBLIC INVESTING, INC.</b></p>

<p>Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds (except for Treasuries offered through your Jiko Account) are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.  Additional information about Public Investing can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered.  Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured.  Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits. Additional information about SIPC can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.  Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Margin-Disclosure-Statement-2024.09.19.pdf">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Apex-Margin-and-Short-Account-Agreement.pdf">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-ira">Individual Retirement Accounts</b><br />
Self-directed individual retirement accounts are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Information about retirement accounts on Public is for educational purposes only and is not tax or investment advice. Consult your tax advisor for individual considerations. Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="../disclosures/Open-to-the-Public-Investing-Inc.-Fixed-Income-Disclosure.pdf">fixed income</a> and <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Apex-Fractional-Bond-Disclosure-1.pdf">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="../disclosures/Bond-Account-Disclosure-1.pdf">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> to learn more. </p>
<p>
<b>Fractional Shares</b><br />
Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable. For a complete explanation of conditions, restrictions and limitations associated with fractional shares, see our <a href="../disclosures/Fractional-Shares-Trading-Disclosure-03.21.2024.pdf">Fractional Share Disclosure</a> to learn more. </p>
<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

<b>JIKO SECURITIES, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Jiko Accounts</b><br />
Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
