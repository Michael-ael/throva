<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.

<b>Options.</b><br />

Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Margin-Disclosure-Statement-2024.09.19.pdf">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Apex-Margin-and-Short-Account-Agreement.pdf">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>

<b id="disclosures-ira">Individual Retirement Accounts</b><br />
Self-directed individual retirement accounts are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Information about retirement accounts on Public is for educational purposes only and is not tax or investment advice. Consult your tax advisor for individual considerations. Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="../disclosures/Open-to-the-Public-Investing-Inc.-Fixed-Income-Disclosure.pdf">fixed income</a> and <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Apex-Fractional-Bond-Disclosure-1.pdf">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="../disclosures/Bond-Account-Disclosure-1.pdf">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> to learn more. </p>
<p>
<b>Fractional Shares</b><br />
Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable. For a complete explanation of conditions, restrictions and limitations associated with fractional shares, see our <a href="../disclosures/Fractional-Shares-Trading-Disclosure-03.21.2024.pdf">Fractional Share Disclosure</a> to learn more. </p>
<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

<b>JIKO SECURITIES, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Jiko Accounts</b><br />
Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
