</p><h2 id="understanding-the-ethereum-infrastructure">Understanding the Ethereum infrastructure</h2><p>Before we dive deeper, let&rsquo;s dig into the <a href="https://public.com/learn/what-is-ethereum-an-explainer">Ethereum</a> blockchain. Ethereum is the blockchain technology that underpins the native crypto asset Ether (ETH).&nbsp;</p><p>The Ethereum blockchain is a distributed ledger that functions without the intervention of centralized intermediaries like banks. The obvious question is: Who maintains and updates the ledger? The Ethereum network uses a security system called a <i>consensus mechanism</i> to add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain.</p><p>Since it was created in July 2015, Ethereum has been using the Proof-of-Work mechanism to validate on-chain transactions. However, Ethereum developers have been working for a long time to transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus. But, why? To answer the question, let us first explain how the two mechanisms work.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="difference-between-proof-of-work-pow-and-proof-of-stake-pos">Difference between Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</h2><p>In Proof-of-Work, miners compete against each other by using energy-intensive mining rigs to solve complex computations.The winner validates transactions and earns rewards in the blockchain&rsquo;s native cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin miners earn Bitcoin for successfully validating transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>PoW miners with more computational energy have a greater chance of validating transactions. However, complex computations lead to high energy consumption for PoW blockchains. For instance, 1 Ethereum transaction consumes <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1265891/ethereum-energy-consumption-transaction-comparison-visa/" rel="nofollow">238 kWh of energy</a>. In comparison, 100K VISA transactions consume just 149 kWh of energy.</p><p>On the contrary, in Proof-of-Stake, stakers lock their crypto to become validators. The protocol randomly chooses validators to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain. Validators receive the native cryptocurrency as incentives for validating legitimate transactions. However, slashing forfeits the staked crypto as a penalty if someone approves illegitimate transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Since staking does not require competition among energy-guzzling computing machines, PoS blockchains are highly energy-efficient. It is one of the primary reasons why Ethereum wants to migrate from PoW to PoS. The Ethereum Foundation states that the transition to Proof-of-Stake will reduce Ethereum&rsquo;s energy usage by <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more" rel="nofollow">99.5%</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><small><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6889" src="https://public.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Proof-of-Work-vs-Proof-of-Stake.png" alt="Proof Of Work vs Proof Of Stake" width="1235" height="538" srcset="https://public.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Proof-of-Work-vs-Proof-of-Stake.png 1235w, https://public.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Proof-of-Work-vs-Proof-of-Stake-300x131.png 300w, https://public.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Proof-of-Work-vs-Proof-of-Stake-1024x446.png 1024w, https://public.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Proof-of-Work-vs-Proof-of-Stake-768x335.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Source: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/proof-of-stake-a-stake-through-proof-of-works-heart/" rel="nofollow">Coindesk</a></small></p><p>Now that you know the basics, it&rsquo;s time to get to the real issue: The Merge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-is-the-merge">What is the Merge?</h2><p>The Merge is a significant Ethereum upgrade that will mark the complete transition of the Ethereum ecosystem to the Proof-of-Stake mechanism. In technical terms, the Merge means the joining of the Ethereum Mainnet with the Beacon chain. Let&rsquo;s break this down into simpler terms.</p><p>Just like Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day, the Ethereum Merge isn&rsquo;t an overnight event. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, published two articles on Proof-of-Stake in <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity" rel="nofollow">2014</a> and <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html" rel="nofollow">2020</a>. As the timeline demonstrates, the transition from PoW to PoS is a long-drawn event. One of the first steps of the Merge was the launch of the Beacon chain.</p><p>The Beacon chain, the side chain that introduced staking to Ethereum, went live on December 1, 2020. The Beacon chain existed as a separate chain and did not handle any smart contract data or process transactions. However, Beacon coordinated a network of stakers, reaching a consensus on its own state through its active validators. At the time of writing, Beacon has 417,598 active validators.</p><p>The Beacon consensus layer has been running parallel to the Mainnet chain leading up to the Merge. After the Merge, the Beacon chain will become the consensus engine for Ethereum and can process execution layer transactions. In other words, the Merge will officially make the Beacon chain the engine of block production with Proof-of-Stake as consensus.&nbsp;</p><p>The Merge is a sophisticated and complex procedure. Thus, it requires rigorous testing and trial runs before the official merging of the two chains. The following section provides a broad overview of some major Ethereum updates.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="timeline-of-ethereum-merge-updates">Timeline of Ethereum Merge updates</h2><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>London hard fork (August 5, 2021)</b>: The <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559" rel="nofollow">EIP-1559</a> and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3554" rel="nofollow">EIP-3554</a> introduced new fee structures to eventually make mining unprofitable for miners.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Altair upgrade (October 27, 2021)</b>: Node operators had to upgrade their client servers, otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to participate in the network after the Merge.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Arrow Glacier upgrade (December 9, 2021)</b>: It pushed back the date of the &ldquo;difficulty bomb&rdquo; to June 2022. The difficulty bomb forces PoW networks to stop producing blocks and disincentivize miners.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Kiln testnet merge (March 16, 2022)</b>: This event involved a test run of the PoW execution layer merging with PoS Beacon. Tim Beiko, a core Ethereum member, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1503752683701870592?s=20&amp;t=xAqodExyfFrd0qUhXWUbkw" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a> that validators can produce transaction-filled blocks after merging.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Ropsten testnet merge (June 8, 2022)</b>: It was the first of three public testnet to undergo successful merging and had a 99% participation rate</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Gray Glacier upgrade (June 30, 2022)</b>: This pushed the difficulty bomb by 700,000 blocks to sometime in September.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sepolia testnet merge (July 6, 2022)</b>: Thiswas the second public testnet, which was also successful.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Goerli testnet merge (August 10, 2022)</b>: This was the final public testnet which demonstrated a successful migration to Proof-of-Stake.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Mainnet shadow forks 1-10 (from April 10, 2022)</b>: Developers conducted a test run of the Merge on the primary network with a small number of network nodes. This would give a realistic idea of how PoS would function in realistic conditions.</li>
</ul><h2 id="when-is-the-merge-happening">When is the Merge happening?</h2><p>Following years of gradual updates and testing, the Ethereum Foundation is readying the Ethereum Merge for mid-September 2022.</p><p>There are certain factors that will decide the exact date of the Merge. The Bellatrix upgrade will activate on the Beacon chain on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/24/ethereum-merge-has-an-official-kick-off-date/" rel="nofollow">September 6, 2022</a>, which will eventually make PoW mining impossible on Ethereum. Once that happens, the Execution layer will merge with the Consensus layer, and Ethereum will become a PoS blockchain.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="common-misconceptions-about-the-merge">Common misconceptions about the Merge</h2><p>The hype around the Merge has led to some misconceptions and myths. We want to dispel these misunderstandings for Ethereum investors.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Myth 1: The Merge will reduce transaction fees (gas fees).</b></p><p>No, it will not. The Merge is a transition from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake algorithm. It is not an expansion of network capacity. Therefore, high network demand can still result in high gas.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Myth 2: Transactions will be faster after the Merge.</b>&nbsp;</p><p>No, there won&rsquo;t be any significant difference in transaction speed. While PoW takes 13.3 seconds to add a new block, the Beacon chain slots occur every 12 seconds. PoS block production is 10% faster than PoW blocks, which is practically unnoticeable.</p><p><b>Myth 3: You need to stake 32 ETH to run a node.</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Validators require a significant stake in Ether (ETH) in order to run a node. These nodes hold block proposers accountable, verify their validity, and propagate it through the network. However, block proposal node providers have to commit economic resources (GPU hash power or staked ETH).</p><p><b>Myth 4: You can withdraw the ETH staked after the Merge.</b></p><p>No, withdrawals will be disabled on the Beacon chain till the Shanghai upgrade, which may take 6-12 months.</p><p><b>Myth 5: Validators will not receive any liquid ETH rewards.</b></p><p>No, validators will instantly receive their fees and rewards earned while proposing new blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Myth 6: After the Shanghai upgrade, there will be a mass exodus of ETH stakers.</b></p><p>No, the protocol limits validator exit rates which adjust itself according to the ETH staked. Currently, only 1,350 validators can exit every day (only 43,200 ETH out of 10 million ETH).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Merge is the stepping stone towards a radically transformed Ethereum. Although the Merge itself won&rsquo;t make Ethereum faster and more scalable, it will lay the foundation for future developments. Vitalik Buterin has <a href="https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1550315295402668032" rel="nofollow">laid out</a> a 4-stage roadmap for Post-Merge Ethereum development.</p><ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>The Surge</b>: It will introduce scalability to Ethereum via sharding and rollups. Sharding will split Ethereum into 64 smaller chains to distribute the network data. Optimistic rollups and Zero-knowledge rollups will execute transactions on layer-2 networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>The Verge</b>: It will also make Ethereum more scalable through the introduction of Verkle trees. Verkle is an upgrade from Merkle trees that optimizes storage by reducing the node size.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>The Purge</b>: It will reduce historical data storage, thereby minimizing network congestion. Buterin believes this will increase Ethereum&rsquo;s efficiency, as the network will be able to process 100K transactions per second.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>The Splurge</b>: It is the ultimate stage to ensure that Ethereum runs smoothly and the updates do not cause any hindrance to users.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>There are several material upgrades ahead in Ethereum&rsquo;s evolution, with many stages ahead in the blockchain&rsquo;s overhaul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-will-eth-holders-do-for-the-merge">What will ETH holders do for the Merge?</h2><p>Investors in the Ether crypto asset, ETH, should not expect major changes following the Merge given that the updates are to the crypto asset&rsquo;s &ldquo;rails&rdquo; and not the ETH asset itself. ETH investors are expected to have the same ability to trade and store ETH with no anticipated disruptions. Importantly, the Merge is NOT a hard fork, so the transaction history will remain unaltered. The funds in your wallet or in the associated wallet of your crypto exchange, will still be yours after the Merge. You do not need to upgrade anything.</p><p>Some crypto watchers warn that the Merge event could cause an uptick in attempted scams to dupe investors during this high-visibility moment. One example is a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/security/#:~:text=&apos;Eth2&apos;%20token%20scam,-With%20The%20Merge&amp;text=Scammers%20may%20appear%20in%20the,may%20represent%20staked%20ETH%20(ie." rel="nofollow">dubious project offering &ldquo;ETH2 tokens&rdquo;</a> with the aim of executing what&rsquo;s called a <a href="https://public.com/learn/how-to-spot-crypto-scams-and-rug-pulls">crypto rug pull</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="will-the-merge-affect-eth-price">Will the Merge affect ETH price?</h2><p>Historical data shows that news about the Merge launch date and successful test runs have resulted in upward <a href="../crypto/eth.html">ETH price</a> movements, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that in investing, past performance does not guarantee future events.The news of the expected Merge date caused ETH to rise above $1,500 in July 2022. Similarly, ETH <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-11/ether-at-two-month-peak-on-signs-of-success-in-key-software-test#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow">surpassed the $1,900 mark</a> on August 11, 2022, reaching a two-month high after the Goerli test. However, in early September, it has fallen back to a level of around $1,500.</p><p>Some analysts believe that in the near term, the Merge is already priced into the current price of ETH. Longer-term, some bullish analysts believe that future potential of the Merge and subsequent upgrades will strengthen the value of ETH over time, although these are predictions and not guarantees. In addition, bear market conditions and market volatility make it more difficult to hypothesize how the Merge will impact prices in the near-and long-term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id="should-you-invest-in-eth">Should you invest in ETH?</h2><p>Ethereum 2.0 is expected to reduce the carbon footprint of Ethereum, and push for more decentralization and security. Moreover, staking will bring down ETH token issuance by almost 90%, making it a potential hedge against inflation. Some bullish crypto investors believe that ETH has potential to appreciate in value over time &ndash; though others are skeptical of cryptocurrency as a whole. However, your decision to invest should depend on your research, financial goals, and risk appetite.</p><p><strong><i>Editor&rsquo;s tip</i></strong><i><strong>:</strong> Crypto investing on Public.com: Sign up today to build a portfolio of crypto assets, stocks, NFTs, and alternative assets.

Before investing, consider your investment objectives, all fees and expenses, and any potential conflicts of interest.

<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.

<b>OPEN TO THE PUBLIC INVESTING, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Securities, Options, and Bonds.</b></p>
<p>Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds (except for Treasuries offered through your Jiko Account) are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.  Additional information about Public Investing can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered.  Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured.  Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits. Additional information about SIPC can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.  Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Margin-Disclosure-Statement-2024.09.19.pdf">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Apex-Margin-and-Short-Account-Agreement.pdf">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>

Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="../disclosures/Open-to-the-Public-Investing-Inc.-Fixed-Income-Disclosure.pdf">fixed income</a> and <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Apex-Fractional-Bond-Disclosure-1.pdf">fractional bonds</a>.

<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> to learn more. </p>
<p>
<b>Fractional Shares</b><br />
Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable. For a complete explanation of conditions, restrictions and limitations associated with fractional shares, see our <a href="../disclosures/Fractional-Shares-Trading-Disclosure-03.21.2024.pdf">Fractional Share Disclosure</a> to learn more. </p>
<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

<b>JIKO SECURITIES, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Jiko Accounts</b><br />
Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
