</section><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p>Market downturns are nearly impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy. But what if there was a way to potentially capitalise&nbsp; even when financial markets fell?</p><p>Put options stand out in this regard. Let&rsquo;s understand more about put options and how to use them. The Options Clearing Corporations also offers a helpful document that discusses the characteristics and risks of options, which can be found on their <a href="http://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p><p>This comprehensive guide delves into the mechanics of put options, helping you navigate their intricacies and employ them strategically in your trading portfolio.</p>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="what-is-a-put-option">What is a put option?</h2><p>A put option is a contractual agreement that grants the holder the option to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specific time period.</p><p>An important consideration here is <strong>lot size</strong>, which represents the number of shares the put option contract covers. It allows you to determine the quantity of the underlying asset you can sell if you exercise the option. Lot sizes vary depending on the specific financial instrument and exchange regulations.</p><p>The <strong>strike price</strong> is the agreed-upon price at which you can sell the underlying asset. It determines the potential profit or loss when exercising a put option. If the market price falls below the strike price, you can exercise the option and sell the asset at a higher price, effectively protecting yourself against further losses.</p><p>Investors often utilize put options as a form of hedging, which involves taking an <strong>offsetting position</strong> to protect against potential losses. This is done to minimize downside risk and create a safeguard against unfavorable market movements by purchasing put options.</p><p>It&rsquo;s essential to remember that put options come with their own risks. For example, if the price of the underlying asset remains above the strike price at expiration, the put option expires worthless and the investor loses the entire premium paid for the option. Additionally, as with all options, put options are subject to time decay, meaning their value decreases as they get closer to their expiration date.<br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you buy a put option for a company at a premium of $2. The lot size is 100, the strike price is $50, and the options expire in three months. You can sell 100 company shares at $50 per share within that time frame.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the stock price drops to $40 during the option period. At this point, you can exercise the put option and sell the shares for a profit of $10 per share (strike price minus market price). Because you initially invested $200 for the put option, you will make a net profit of $800 ($10 per share profit multiplied by 100 shares minus the initial option premium cost).</p>

Below are some common types of put options and how they are used:</p>
</div>
<section class="wgt-list list-type-numbered list-style-inline" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 50px">

	<?xml encoding="UTF-8">
<ol class="list list-inline">
	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="stock-put-option">Stock put option:</strong> A stock put option gives the holder the right to sell a specific number of shares of an individual stock at a pre-specified price (strike price) within a given timeframe. It acts as a hedging tool that generates profit from stock market downsides. It also offers flexibility in managing investment portfolios and can be used as a strategic tool based on market conditions and individual risk tolerance. It should, however, be noted that buyer of the stock put option could lose the premium they paid to purchase the options if not exercised. </p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="index-put-option">Index put option:</strong> An index put option grants the holder the right to sell an entire market index &ndash; such as the <a href="https://hellopublic.wpengine.com/learn/what-is-the-sp-500" rel="noopener" target="_blank">S&amp;P 500</a> or Nasdaq 100 &ndash; at a predetermined strike price within a specific timeframe. Index put options offer exposure to a broad market index rather than individual stocks. Thus, investors consider this type for diversification. It should, however, be noted that buyer of the index put option could lose the premium they paid to purchase the options if not exercised.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="commodity-put-option">Commodity put option: </strong> A commodity put option gives the holder the right to sell a specified amount of a particular commodity, such as oil, gold, or wheat, at a set price within a specific timeframe. It is usually used by investors who deal in commodities to hedge against declining commodity prices. It should, however, be noted that buyer of the commodity put option could lose the premium they paid to purchase the options if not exercised.</p><p>Farmers often favor this type of option. Let&rsquo;s say a farmer anticipates a price drop for wheat and wishes to safeguard their investment. In that case, they can buy a commodity put option and sell it at a predetermined price when the price drops. If the price increases instead, the farmer incurs a loss equal to the premium paid for the contract.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="currency-put-option">Currency put option:</strong> A currency put option provides you with an option to sell a specific amount of currency for another currency at an exchange rate that has already been set within a stipulated time frame. This type of option can protect against adverse currency movements and offer a certain level of control over potential exchange rate fluctuations within the agreed timeframe.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that the buyer of the currency put option could lose the premium they paid if it goes unexercised.</p><p>Assuming you anticipate the Euro depreciating against the US dollar, you can buy put options on the Euro to sell at a predetermined exchange rate and profit when it falls against the US dollar. However, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that if the Euro appreciates instead, there&rsquo;s a possibility of losing the premium paid for the contract.</p>

This allows investors to make a profit if the asset increases in value.</p><p>The functioning of a put option differs from a call option in terms of rights and profit potential. Covered calls involve selling call options against an owned asset to generate income, while put options serve as a protective strategy against potential market downturns. It is important to note that buyers of the call option could lose any premiums paid for their options.</p>

These include market liquidity, sentiment, overall market conditions, and specific events or news affecting the underlying asset.</p>
</div>
<section class="wgt-list list-type-bullets list-style-inline" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 50px">

	<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p>Let&rsquo;s explore the key factors that impact the pricing of put options:</p>
<ul class="list list-inline">
	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="underlying-asset-price">Underlying asset price: </strong> The price of the underlying asset plays a significant role in determining the value of a put option. Put options become more valuable as the price of the underlying asset decreases. A lower asset price increases the potential profit from selling the asset at the strike price. Conversely, if the underlying asset&rsquo;s price rises, the put option&rsquo;s value declines and potential profit decreases.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you buy a put option on Company X with a strike price of $100. If the share price falls to $90, the put option allows you to sell the stock at $100, resulting in a $10 profit per share. However, if the stock price rises to $110, the put option loses value and profit potential is lost.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="strike-price">Strike price: </strong> Put options with higher strike prices are generally more expensive than those with lower strike prices. That is because put options with higher strike prices give the holder a higher potential profit if the underlying asset&rsquo;s price declines significantly. The proximity of the strike price to the current market price, therefore, affects the pricing of put options.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="time-to-expiration">Time to expiration: </strong> The time frame remaining until the <a href="options-expiration.html" target="_blank">option&rsquo;s expiration date</a> significantly affects the price of a put option. As the expiration date approaches, the time value of the put option decreases because there is less time for the underlying asset&rsquo;s price to move in a favorable direction. Put options with a longer time to expiration tend to have higher premiums, as there is more opportunity for the underlying asset price to move favourably for the option holder.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="implied-volatility">Implied volatility: </strong> Implied volatility measures market expectations regarding the future price volatility of the underlying asset. Higher levels of implied volatility generally lead to increased put option prices. Higher volatility implies a higher likelihood of significant price swings in the underlying asset, increasing the potential for profits if the asset price decreases. Conversely, lower implied volatility results in lower put option prices.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="risk-free-interest-rate">Risk-free interest rate: </strong> Risk-free interest rates are other factors impacting put option pricing. Put option prices are influenced by the opportunity cost of holding the underlying asset. If the risk-free interest rate is higher, the cost of holding the asset is also higher. As a result, current prices may increase due to the increased cost of foregoing the risk-free interest rate while holding the asset.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="dividends">Dividends: </strong> If the underlying asset pays dividends, it can affect the price of put options. Higher dividend payments generally reduce the value of put options. That is because the dividends offset potential losses from declining asset prices, reducing the risk of holding the asset. Putting options on assets with higher dividend yields may result in lower premiums.</p>
	</li>

</ul></section><div class="entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p>Note that these factors do not work in isolation; they influence each other and react to other market conditions to determine the final price of a put option. You must analyze these factors meticulously to make informed decisions regarding the purchase or sale of put options based on your expectations of the underlying asset&rsquo;s price movement.</p>

<ul class="list list-inline">
	<li>
		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="generating-cash-flow">Generating cash flow: </strong> Selling put options enables investors to collect upfront premiums, which can provide immediate cash flow. By writing put options, investors commit to buying the underlying asset at the strike price if the option is exercised. If the option is not exercised, however, investors can keep the premium as profit. This strategy allows you to generate consistent cash flow while potentially acquiring the asset at a lower price.</p>

		<?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><strong id="acquiring-the-underlying-asset-at-a-lower-price">Acquiring the underlying asset at a lower price:</strong> For investors interested in acquiring a specific asset but perceive it as overpriced, selling put options can be considered. By selling put options with strike prices below the current market price, investors position themselves to potentially acquire the asset at a discount if the options are exercised. This approach allows investors to capitalise on market inefficiencies and potentially obtain assets at more favourable prices.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Frequently asked questions</h2><details open><summary><h3>How do you exercise a put option?</h3></summary><p>To exercise a put option, notify your broker of your intention to sell the underlying asset at the predetermined strike price. Your broker will facilitate the transaction, allowing you to sell the asset.</p>
</details><details open><summary><h3>How do you close a put option?</h3></summary><p>To close a put option position, you can either sell the put option contract before its expiration date or let it expire. You can capture any remaining value by selling the contract and exiting the position. If you let it expire, it has no value and your position is automatically closed.</p>
</details><details open><summary><h3>How to calculate the put option profit?</h3></summary><p>To calculate the put option profit, subtract the put option&#8217;s premium (the cost to purchase the option) from the difference between the strike price and the actual stock price at expiration. If the result is positive, it represents your profit. However, there is no profit if the result is negative or zero.</p>
<p>For instance, if you buy a put option for Company A with a strike price of $50 and a premium of $2, and the stock price at expiration is $40, your profit would be $8 ($50 &#8211; $40 &#8211; $2) per share. If the stock price at expiration is $60, however, there would be no profit as the option would expire without any gain.</p>
<p>Various trading platforms also come with an integrated options calculator to help investors. </p>
</details><details open><summary><h3>Why is a put option called a put?</h3></summary><p>A put option is called so because it gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to ‘put’ or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price within a specified timeframe. This distinguishes it from a <a href="what-are-call-options-and-how-do-they-work.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">call option</a>, which provides the right to ‘call’ or buy the asset.</p>
</details><details open><summary><h3>How long does a typical put options contract last?</h3></summary><p>There are various types of put options available. Some expire on the same day, whereas others expire after years. You can see the expiry date of each option before buying it.</p>
</details><details open><summary><h3>Would you have a right or obligation if you sell a put option on a stock?</h3></summary><p>When you sell a put option, you are obligated to <a href="https://public.com/learn/how-to-buy-stocks-etfs-with-a-debit-card" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy the stock</a> at the stick price from the option buyer.</p>
</details><details open><summary><h3>Is buying a put option similar to short selling?</h3></summary><p>Buying a put option and <a href="https://public.com/learn/what-to-know-about-short-selling-stocks" target="_blank">short selling</a> are similar in that both option strategies aim to profit from a decline in the price of an underlying asset. The key difference is that buying a put option involves limited risk, as the maximum loss is limited to the option premium paid. In contrast, short selling has unlimited risk, as losses can theoretically exceed the initial <a href="https://public.com/invest/options?wpsrc=Organic+Search&amp;wpsn=www.google.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">investment</a>. </p>
</details><details open><summary><h3>Can you lose the entire premium paid for a put option?</h3></summary><p>Yes, it is possible to lose the entire premium paid for a put option. If the underlying asset&#8217;s price remains above the strike price at expiration, the put option expires, resulting in a loss equal to the premium paid.</p>

	<p>Options are not suitable for all investors and carry significant risk. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. There are additional costs associated with option strategies that call for multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads, straddles, among others, as compared with a single option trade. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must read the “Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, also known as the options disclosure document (ODD) which can be found at: www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document.</p>

<b>All investments</b> involve the risk of loss and the past performance of a security or a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.

<b>PUBLIC ADVISORS LLC</b></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investment advisory services for Treasury Accounts are provided by Public Advisors LLC (“Public Advisors”), an SEC-registered investment adviser.  Brokerage services are provided by Public Investing (see below).  Public Advisors and Public Investing are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”), and both subsidiaries charge a fee for their respective Treasury Account services.  Before investing, consider your investment objectives, all fees and expenses, and any potential conflicts of interest.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/public-customer-relationship-summary">Form CRS</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>, and other disclosures.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections are provided for informational and illustrative purposes, and may not reflect actual future performance.</p>
<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>.</p>

<b>OPEN TO THE PUBLIC INVESTING, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Securities, Options, and Bonds.</b></p>
<p>Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds (except for Treasuries offered through your Jiko Account) are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.  Additional information about Public Investing can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered.  Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured.  Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits. Additional information about SIPC can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.  Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Margin-Disclosure-Statement-2024.09.19.pdf">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Apex-Margin-and-Short-Account-Agreement.pdf">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-ira">Individual Retirement Accounts</b><br />
Self-directed individual retirement accounts are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Information about retirement accounts on Public is for educational purposes only and is not tax or investment advice. Consult your tax advisor for individual considerations. Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account.

<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
