</ul><p>If the thought of managing your finances gives you a feeling of anxiety and dread, you&rsquo;re not alone. According to <a href="https://www.usfinancialcapability.org/results.php?region=US" rel="nofollow">FINRA Investor Education Foundation</a>, only 34% of Americans can answer 4 out of 5 basic financial literacy questions, significantly contributing to a lower standard of living and the ability to attain financial security.</p><p>An example might read: True or false?&nbsp; A 15-year mortgage requires a higher monthly payment than a 30-year mortgage, but interest over the life of the loan will be less.&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see, the question is directly related to the experience of purchasing a home, something so many of us strive to do in our lives. Without the understanding of how interest rates are calculated, you could easily fall prey to unethical practices by lenders.</p><p>So, what is financial literacy? It&rsquo;s having the knowledge and skills that allow individuals to use all their financial resources to make informed decisions about their financial life.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that a lack of financial education causes a lot of problems for people.&nbsp;</p><p>But, whether we like it or not, our world runs on money. Those who have it enjoy a lifestyle where they not only have their basic needs met, but they can also enjoy the comforts of the things that bring them joy. Whereas those who struggle with money seem to have more difficulties in other areas of their lives.</p><p>In celebration of April&rsquo;s Financial Literacy Month, <a href="../index.html">Public</a>, along with state and federal governments, financial experts, and companies alike, aims to shine a spotlight on financial literacy and the benefits of educating ourselves so we can all live prosperous lives.</p><p><b>Key takeaways</b></p><ul>
<li>Financial literacy is the ability to understand and utilize various financial tools and skills.</li>
<li>Although we have more ways to learn about finances available to us, financial literacy is declining in the U.S..</li>
<li>Without the basic knowledge of finances, Americans are unable to escape the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5450829/" rel="nofollow">unending cycle of debt.</a></li>
<li>Basic financial knowledge includes learning how to pay bills, pay off debt, understand credit, and invest.</li>
<li>Learning about finances isn&rsquo;t as difficult as one might expect. It can offer the opportunities we need to manage money effectively and save for the future. There are a variety of financial services available online to help.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h2 id="why-financial-literacy-is-important">Why financial literacy is important</h2><p>Financial literacy starts when we have our first exposure to money. That may have been as a child, earning an allowance for doing chores around the house or that first job, such as babysitting, dog walking, or mowing lawns.</p><p>What most of us don&rsquo;t realize at the time is that our relationship with money will be a lifetime commitment and will affect every aspect of our lives. While some people grow up in families that educate their children about money, many do not. Either way, we form ideas about money that can shape every decision we make about managing it, including not managing it at all.</p><p>Unfortunately, turning our backs on financial literacy can lead to a variety of problems, such as poor spending habits that lead to unending financial burdens like high-interest debts, credit issues, inability to save for a house, lack of retirement savings, and a variety of additional negative consequences.</p><p>To be clear, the term &ldquo;financial literacy&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean knowing everything about money. Instead, it empowers us to find the answers we need to make sound financial choices.</p><p>As you gain more knowledge about finances and how to utilize the money for your own benefit, you begin asking yourself important questions before you so readily spend it, including:</p><ul>
<li>Do I really need this?</li>
<li>Can I find lower prices elsewhere?</li>
<li>Are there additional costs associated with this decision that I may not be expecting?</li>
<li>How will interest rates affect the total cost?</li>
<li>How will spending money on this benefit me over the long term?</li>
<li>Can I really afford this now?</li>
</ul><p>Once you begin to ask yourself these questions, you&rsquo;ll start to improve your awareness.&nbsp;</p><p>While the ability to understand basic financial concepts is vital, building a foundation also includes your thoughts and feelings that surround the subject of money.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to remember that not everyone views money the same way. For some, it&rsquo;s been the cause of some type of negativity, and the thought of dealing with money makes them want to bury their head in the sand. While others can see the possibilities it can offer and embrace all that comes with it.&nbsp;</p><p>Although our feelings about finances may not seem to affect how we manage our money, a poor relationship with it can do more harm than good. It&rsquo;s important to evaluate those feelings and understand that financial education can be a game changer. When we feel empowered, we want to learn more, and ultimately, we make better decisions.</p><p>Since it&rsquo;s a lifelong journey, when it comes to learning about finances, the earlier we start, the better. If you think about some of the unnecessary things you&rsquo;ve spent money on, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree that if you had only known more about the options, maybe you would have chosen to do something differently. That&rsquo;s why the importance of financial literacy can&rsquo;t be understated.</p><p>A few of the key components of financial literacy include:&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>Personal money management</li>
<li>Budgeting</li>
<li>Paying bills</li>
<li>Saving</li>
<li>Investing</li>
</ul><p>Becoming financially literate will not only take the stress out of financial planning but will give you the ability to navigate all the financial decisions and the tools to manage them effectively.</p><h2 id="financial-literacy-example">Financial literacy example</h2><p>To give kids the best opportunities for success, it&rsquo;s vital to weave conversations about finances into everyday life and include kids in those discussions. Yet, according to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/t-rowe-price-parents-putting-on-a-financial-facade-are-more-reluctant-to-discuss-money-with-their-kids-301195248.html" rel="nofollow">survey by T. Rowe Price</a>, 41% of parents of 8 to 14 year olds have &ldquo;some resistance&rdquo; to discuss money with their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Financial literacy doesn&rsquo;t always come easy, and with so many adults living paycheck to paycheck, teaching our kids about money is more important than ever. After all, it&rsquo;s the one thing we all need to survive and thrive as a member of society.&nbsp;</p><p>With that understanding, some parents have made it a daily practice to start teaching their kids about money as early as 7 years old by implementing a few techniques that include:</p><ul>
<li><b>Pay an allowance </b>&ndash; A regular allowance instills in kids that they need to work to earn money. Doing chores for pay will help them understand that money must be earned.</li>
<li><b>Teach them about savings</b> &ndash; Teaching kids to save the money they earn and watch it grow can be an introduction to the benefits of investing. Parents can help them to set goals for saving, open a savings account, and pick out a piggy bank to save on their own.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Talk about money</b> &ndash; When out with the kids, discuss what you&rsquo;re buying and why. Show them how much it costs and have them look at receipts to see how the purchase was made.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Explain wants vs. needs</b> &ndash; Discuss the difference between what we need to live and what we may want. Explain that needs include the basics such as food, housing, clothing, education, and health, and wants are extra things that cost money, such as toys, eating out, and phones. Spend time asking them about different items and whether they are a need or a want, so they fully understand.</li>
<li><b>Prioritize spending</b> &ndash; Explain why determining what to spend money on is important and why when it&rsquo;s cold outside, a winter coat is a better choice than a new toy.</li>
<li><b>Don&rsquo;t give kids more than what they earn</b> &ndash; To learn the value of money, it&rsquo;s helpful if kids understand that if they earn money and spend it all, it&rsquo;s gone until they make more. They can&rsquo;t learn that lesson if you hand out money every time they ask.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Track spending </b>&ndash; To know where they spend, have your kids keep track of everything they spend each day, and add it up at the end of the week. Ask them about their purchases and how important they were. This can be an eye-opening experience and a great teaching moment for the value of saving.</li>
<li><b>Give them the freedom to make mistakes</b> &ndash; We want to protect our kids from mistakes, but it&rsquo;s one of the best ways to learn valuable lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Teach them to budget</b> &ndash; Showing kids how to create a budget allows them to use and save their money wisely. If they have an expensive item such as a new cell phone or video game they want, teach them how a budget can get them to their goal faster.</li>
<li><b>Match savings</b> &ndash; To encourage kids to save, parents can offer a matching program, much like an employer match program in a 401(k) savings plan. You can either match dollar for dollar or decide on a percentage. Seeing their money grow can be very encouraging, and teaching them the importance of saving will create good habits.</li>
<li><b>Make it fun</b> &ndash; By making it fun to learn about money, their first exposure is positive, which can create an empowering attitude surrounding it. Also, kids learn and remember more when it&rsquo;s fun. With kids so connected, you can even make paying them fun by using apps that assign a dollar value to chores and where they can receive payment and watch their money grow.</li>
</ul><p>As kids become young adults and reach high school, some teachers also prioritize finances. For example, a home economics teacher may weave lessons on financial literacy into classes on budgeting for groceries and household finances.</p><p>Also adding discussions about income and expenses, personal budgeting, managing debt, saving for college, buying a home, and even saving for retirement.</p><p>Even though the class is focused on how to take care of a home and other necessary life skills such as meal planning, shopping, and cooking, finances are directly related to all of those things. Therefore, it&rsquo;s a great opportunity to pass on that knowledge to students, so they have the financial capabilities needed as they move through life.</p><h2 id="characteristics-of-financial-literacy">Characteristics of financial literacy</h2><p>Although we know financial education is essential to help us make sound financial decisions so we can enjoy financial stability and become self-sufficient, it&rsquo;s equally important to avoid the pitfalls that bad financial choices can lead to, such as bad credit and bankruptcy.</p><p>Building financial literacy involves some basic money management skills, such as budgeting, saving, and investing, but there are additional principles that are equally important to rounding out our knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>Things such as learning how to set and achieve goals, managing debt, the power of <a href="what-is-compound-interest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compound interest</a>, and being informed about dishonest financial practices, such as lending schemes, unethical lenders and financial institutions, high-interest loans, fraudulent transactions, and any other challenges that emerge.</p><p>Even though, thanks to the Internet, Americans have more access to financial information than ever before, financial literacy is not improving. And the need to grasp basic financial concepts is more critical than ever. For example, as retirement planning has moved from employee pension funds, where the companies or government sponsors decide on funds, to 401(k) plans where employees choose their own investments, understanding the principles of <a href="how-do-stocks-work.html">how stocks work</a> is even more important now.</p><p>But not all employers offer retirement savings plans, so individuals need to seek out other options for saving, such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs). And with people living longer, Social Security benefits just won&rsquo;t cut it, so having a financial education is no longer a luxury we can live without.</p><p>Learning financial literacy isn&rsquo;t as complicated as you might think. It comes down to a couple of basic principles. The first is to gain control of your personal finances, which involves how you manage your money, set goals, and meet them.&nbsp;</p><p>These objectives may include buying a home, saving for children&rsquo;s college fund, retirement savings, enjoying vacations, and any other goals you and your family may have. Of course, you&rsquo;ll also need to understand banking, paying bills, budgeting finances, credit, interest rates, and investing.</p><h2 id="an-introduction-to-financial-products">An introduction to financial products</h2><p>One of the first financial tools you&rsquo;ve used was, most likely, a savings or checking account at your local bank. Familiarity with the various bank accounts is the first step in preparing for your financial future.</p><p>Most people today have some type of bank account with access to a variety of resources available through their accounts, such as:</p><ul>
<li>Debit and credit cards</li>
<li>Checking accounts</li>
<li>ATMs</li>
<li>Direct deposit</li>
<li>Loans</li>
<li>Mortgages</li>
<li>Interest earning accounts</li>
</ul><p>Although many of us still like to have a local bank, online banks have gained popularity and offer the same services as your local branch. Another option for banking is credit unions, which, unlike banks, are non-profit organizations owned by the members. One major benefit of using a credit union is that it sometimes offers lower fees, as well as low interest rates and personalized customer service.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="basic-accounts">Basic accounts&nbsp;</h3><p>Whether you choose a local bank, credit union, or online banking, there are 3 basic types of accounts you should consider when thinking about how to organize your funds.</p><ul>
<li><b>Checking accounts</b> &ndash; These are liquid accounts, meaning you can easily manage your money by making deposits and withdrawals without any limits. They don&rsquo;t earn interest, but you have access to your money through banks, ATMs, checks, and debit or credit cards. Although you can find accounts without fees, many charge some sort of fee. You&rsquo;ll also have access to direct deposit and bill pay options that can simplify banking tasks.</li>
<li><b>Savings accounts</b> &ndash; These are interest-earning accounts that make short-term saving easy. They are flexible and an ideal solution to save for emergencies and short-term goals, such as a vacation or education.</li>
<li><b>High-yield savings account</b> &ndash; These accounts usually pay higher interest rates than regular savings accounts but require larger deposits and high minimum balances.</li>
</ul><h3 id="an-emergency-fund">An emergency fund</h3><p>An emergency fund can be set up at any financial institution and is an important asset to help to prepare for any unplanned financial needs, such as car repairs, medical expenses, employment gaps, and household expenses. Building up an emergency fund can eliminate the stress of unexpected expenses.</p><h3 id="understanding-debit-and-credit-cards">Understanding debit and credit cards</h3><p>These days when making any type of purchase, we reach for the plastic card in our wallets and swipe, insert, or tap them to check out. Although debit cards attached to our checking accounts are a popular option, not everyone has left credit cards behind.</p><p>While debit cards are an easy option and look like a credit card, the money comes straight out of your account, unlike credit card purchases, where you borrow money that you pay back over time. With credit cards, if you don&rsquo;t pay the balance in full each month, you&rsquo;re charged interest on any remaining balance due.</p><p><b>How debit &amp; credit cards differ</b></p><p><b>Debit cards</b> &ndash; Are attached to your checking account, and any money spent using the debit card comes right out of your account, so you can&rsquo;t spend more than what&rsquo;s in your account. They don&rsquo;t offer any type of credit-building opportunities for the user.</p><p><b>Credit cards</b> &ndash; Allow the user to borrow money in any amount as long as it doesn&rsquo;t exceed their credit limit. They can be used for unexpected expenses if you haven&rsquo;t established an emergency fund. Still, you&rsquo;ll pay interest on any remaining balance that&rsquo;s not paid off in full.</p><p>Although credit cards can help the user build up their credit history, which can be useful to make larger purchases, such as buying a house, they can also be a source of financial troubles for those who don&rsquo;t pay off the balance each month. If interest charges pile up, repayment can feel impossible.</p><p>Credit cards are a leading problem when it comes to debt for Americans. According to <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/08/credit-card-debt-fastest-growth-22-years-holiday-shopping-new-york-fed/" rel="nofollow">Fortune.com</a>, in 2021, there was over $860 billion owed in credit card debt alone, which gives you a good idea of how interest payments can snowball out of control.</p><p>When applying for a credit card, it&rsquo;s a good idea to consider the APR, which is the annual percentage rate of interest. The higher the interest rate, the more you&rsquo;ll pay over and above the unpaid balance on charges. These interest rates can be as high as 16% or higher and add up quickly.</p><p><b>Types of credit cards</b></p><p>Good credit can offer a variety of options when looking to obtain a credit card. Although many of them can offer low introductory rates, no annual fees, and other perks, late payments and time limits can change what you get, so it&rsquo;s essential to read the fine print to understand the terms. Some options include:</p><ul>
<li><b>Zero-interest rates</b> &ndash; These cards don&rsquo;t charge annual interest on purchases made, but if payments are late, many charge high interest, which can get you in trouble.</li>
<li><b>Cashback</b> &ndash; The terms on this type of card are that you&rsquo;ll receive a small portion of cashback each month in cash or a credit on your monthly statement.</li>
<li><b>Travel rewards</b> &ndash; These cards give points that can be redeemed when traveling for flights, rental cars, and hotels.</li>
<li><b>Balance transfers</b> &ndash; Transferring high-interest rate balances from another card can save thousands of dollars and help pay it off faster.</li>
</ul><p>When evaluating credit cards, it&rsquo;s essential to check all options and be aware of your protections under the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/equal-credit-opportunity-act-3" rel="nofollow">Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</a>, which prohibits discrimination in lending and all aspects of credit transitions.</p><h2 id="improving-financial-literacy">Improving financial literacy</h2><p>Financial literacy comes down to mastering a set of skills that can improve your financial life and give you the tools necessary to plan for the future. Here are some things you can do to improve your financial literacy.</p><ul>
<li><b>Pay yourself first</b> &ndash; You&rsquo;ve heard it before, and it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s one of the most important things you can do to ensure you save. To get started, set a savings goal and decide how much to save each month toward that goal, and put that money away before utilizing it for expenses.</li>
<li><b>Pay bills on time</b> &ndash; Bills have a way of creeping up on us each month, and for some, that can mean late payments and additional late fees. Setting up bills on autopay where they are deducted from your checking account by the due date will eliminate late payments and keep your credit score high.</li>
<li><b>Manage debt payments</b> &ndash; It&rsquo;s vital to stay on top of any debt payments and make sure they are paid on time. Of course, paying it off is always a good idea to relieve unnecessary financial stress.</li>
<li><b>Review your credit report</b> &ndash; You are entitled to a free credit report that shows all credit accounts and their status every year. Review these reports to ensure they are correct and report any discrepancies to the credit bureau(s). To receive your report, contact any of the 3 major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian, or Transunion, through the website <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com" rel="nofollow">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>.</li>
<li><b>Review your credit score</b> &ndash; Credit scores are measured on a scale from 300 to 850 points. The higher your score, the better chance you have of getting low-interest loans and the ability to show your creditworthiness.</li>
<li><b>Save for retirement</b> &ndash; Regularly <a href="how-to-invest-in-stocks.html">investing in stocks</a> or any type of retirement account is a positive step in preparing for your future. Whether through your employer&rsquo;s 401(k) or an individual retirement account (IRA), automating it is key to make the most of compound interest. If you&rsquo;re a <a href="investing-for-beginners.html">beginner investor</a>, take a look at the <a href="../signup.html">Public </a>app, which allows you to invest with no minimum. You can get started today.</li>
<li><b>Budget your money</b> &ndash; The only way to know where your money is going each week is to track spending and income. Include paychecks and all other income, such as side gigs, alimony, or rental income in your budget. Add all expenses such as rent, utilities, and other living expenses, and savings, and track it over several months.</li>
</ul><h3 id="creating-a-budget">Creating a budget</h3><p>The best way to gain control of your financial situation is to create a detailed budget of all income and expenses. There are several ways to organize the information, such as using an app, an Excel spreadsheet, or money management software, so use whatever works best for you. Follow these steps to get started organizing your funds into a budget:</p><p><b>First, first all your income sources:&nbsp;</b></p><ul>
<li>Paycheck</li>
<li>Side hustles</li>
<li>Alimony</li>
<li>Settlements</li>
<li>Hobby income</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul><p><b>Then, list all your expenses:</b></p><ul>
<li><b>Fixed expenses &ndash; </b>Mortgage payments or rent, utilities, car payments, student loan payments.</li>
<li><b>Discretionary expenses</b> &ndash; Dining out, shopping, travel, entertainment, clothing, and gifts (all non-essential expenses).</li>
<li><b>Savings</b> &ndash; Money you save each month.</li>
</ul><p>With all the numbers in front of you, add up income and then subtract&nbsp; the expenses to see how much you have available. Any funds available could go into creating or building an emergency fund, or if you are in debt, you may consider making extra payments to pay them down.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Budgeting rules</b></p><p>Once you have a sense of how much is coming and going out of your budget each month, you might want to be more strategic about your saving and spending. When it comes to budgeting, 2 common strategies can simplify the process: the 50/20/30 rule and 70/20/10 rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="what-is-the-50-30-20-rule.html"><b>The 50/20/30 budget rule</b></a> &ndash; This rule tells us to take your after-tax income and divide it into 3 categories: needs, wants, and savings where 50% is allocated to needs, 30% is assigned to wants, and 20% is allocated to savings.</p><p>The <b>50%</b> assigned to needs includes funds that go toward bills that must be paid each month. This includes your mortgage or rental payment, insurance, healthcare, car payments, utilities, minimum debt payments, and groceries.</p><p>The general rule is that the 50% should cover all your needs, and if it doesn&rsquo;t, you may want to evaluate your spending and reduce those payments.</p><p>The <b>30% </b>allocated to wants includes non-essential items such as shopping, eating out, vacations, entertainment, and gym memberships. Upgrades are also considered in this category. These are things such as a more expensive vehicle, movie channels, extravagant dinners, and designer clothing. They are things you can live without.</p><p>The<b> 20%</b> allocated for savings includes retirement contributions such as to a 401(k), IRA, or other investment accounts, emergency fund(s), and college funds. Remember, it&rsquo;s recommended to have 3 months of living expenses saved for emergencies.</p><p>The 50/20/30 rule is intended to help keep track of finances and help prepare people for life&rsquo;s unexpected expenses and the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>The 70/20/10 budget rule</b> &ndash; This budgeting method allocates 70% to spending, 20% to savings and investing, and 10% to debts and donations.&nbsp;</p><p>The<b> 70%</b> includes mortgage or rental payments, utilities and insurance, healthcare, car, bills and debts, groceries, shopping, recreation, vacations, and any other expenses that would be considered needs and wants.</p><p>The<b> 20%</b> is allocated to investment and retirement accounts such as a 401(k), IRA, or other retirement accounts. This can also include what&rsquo;s called a sinking fund, which is a type of savings account for larger expenses that may occur, such as a new car, planning for a wedding or college, a vacation, household repairs or a swimming pool, or any other large purchases.</p><p>The <b>10%</b> goes toward paying additional debt payments, donations, or gifts such as birthday, baby, or wedding gifts, charities, or lending money.</p><p>The 50/20/30 rule and 70/20/10 rule are both simple methods for managing money and budget planning that keep finances organized and easy to understand due to the streamlined use of fewer categories.&nbsp;</p><p>Using them doesn&rsquo;t take much time and can make what can be an overwhelming task something that can be done in less time, especially if you dread the idea of creating a detailed budget. It&rsquo;s also an easy way to learn more about financial literacy for beginners.</p><h2 id="financial-illiteracy-risks">Financial illiteracy risks</h2><p>Unfortunately, in the U.S., many adults don&rsquo;t possess the basic financial skills needed to make sound decisions about everyday financial issues. Despite the fact that money is a vital part of our society, it&rsquo;s not routinely taught in schools, and for so many, that&rsquo;s where any possibility of a financial education ends.</p><p>Without any type of financial knowledge, any lessons learned may come from inaccurate advice passed down from families or costly mistakes often discovered after the damage has been done.</p><p>But it goes even deeper than that. For those who are financially illiterate, a lack of understanding can mean debilitating credit card debt, high-interest loans, substandard living conditions, little to no retirement savings, and an inability to thrive.</p><p>Parents who don&rsquo;t have knowledge of the basic principles of finance can&rsquo;t educate their kids, and the cycle may continue. And of course, add on to that the ever-changing rules of finance in lending industries, the unending credit card offers, and fraudulent companies calling us to extract our personal financial information for their gain, and it can feel like a losing battle.</p><p>The only way to combat each of those issues is to educate ourselves and continue to learn and practice financial literacy.</p><h2 id="financial-literacy-benefits">Financial literacy benefits</h2><p>The ability to manage our money is one of the most empowering skills we have. It gives us the awareness to make informed decisions about all aspects of our finances, including saving, investing, spending, borrowing, and budgeting.</p><p>The knowledge we gain offers us the opportunity to reach short-term and long-term financial goals and gives us the financial stability and well-being to thrive in all areas of our lives.</p><p>A few direct benefits of personal financial literacy is the ability to:</p><ul>
<li>Budget effectively</li>
<li>Understand loan terms</li>
<li>Get the proper insurance</li>
<li>Track healthcare expenses</li>
<li>Purchase a home or other real estate</li>
<li>Manage the use of credit</li>
<li>Understand interest rates</li>
<li>Save for retirement</li>
<li>Understand financial aid options</li>
</ul><p>When we understand the basics of our finances, we tend to make better money decisions overall, maintain healthy spending habits, and <a href="how-to-save-for-retirement.html">save for retirement</a>, which leads to lower stress levels and happier lives.</p><p>Without the financial skills needed, individuals may find themselves living paycheck to paycheck, drowning in debt, paying high-interest rates, and unable to save for the future.</p><h2 id="getting-a-lesson-in-financial-literacy">Getting a lesson in financial literacy</h2><p>No matter where you are in your knowledge of financial literacy, there&rsquo;s always a way to learn and grow that understanding to benefit yourself and your family. Here are a few places to help:</p><ul>

<b>All investments</b> involve the risk of loss and the past performance of a security or a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.

<b>PUBLIC ADVISORS LLC</b></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investment advisory services for Treasury Accounts are provided by Public Advisors LLC (“Public Advisors”), an SEC-registered investment adviser.  Brokerage services are provided by Public Investing (see below).  Public Advisors and Public Investing are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”), and both subsidiaries charge a fee for their respective Treasury Account services.  Before investing, consider your investment objectives, all fees and expenses, and any potential conflicts of interest.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/public-customer-relationship-summary">Form CRS</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>, and other disclosures.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections are provided for informational and illustrative purposes, and may not reflect actual future performance.</p>
<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>.</p>

<b>OPEN TO THE PUBLIC INVESTING, INC.</b></p>

Additional information about Public Investing can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered.

<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.  Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.

<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>

<b id="disclosures-ira">Individual Retirement Accounts</b><br />
Self-directed individual retirement accounts are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Information about retirement accounts on Public is for educational purposes only and is not tax or investment advice. Consult your tax advisor for individual considerations. Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="../disclosures/Open-to-the-Public-Investing-Inc.-Fixed-Income-Disclosure.pdf">fixed income</a> and <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Apex-Fractional-Bond-Disclosure-1.pdf">fractional bonds</a>.

<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> to learn more. </p>
<p>
<b>Fractional Shares</b><br />
Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable.

<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

<b>JIKO SECURITIES, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Jiko Accounts</b><br />
Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
