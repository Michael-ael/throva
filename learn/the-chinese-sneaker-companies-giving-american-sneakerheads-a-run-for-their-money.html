There are going to be ups and downs,&rdquo; says Dellavedova. &ldquo;But the journey is worth it.&rdquo;</p><p>

</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of the NBA, you know that Matthew was never an elite athlete. He went undrafted in 2013 out of Saint Mary&rsquo;s, and scrapped his way to the league by way of a two year, $1.3 million contract (with only $100,000 guaranteed) on the far end of the Cleveland Cavaliers&rsquo; roster. But over the next few seasons, &ldquo;Delly&rdquo; became a cult hero for his scrappy defense and down-under charm. He famously played above his abilities defending Steph Curry in the 2015 Finals &mdash; and, in 2016, as the Cavs won their first NBA championship behind a heroic effort from LeBron James, he became an international celebrity alongside the rest of the roster. Dellavedova only averaged seven points and four assists during his title season, which makes him an unlikely sneaker star to most.</p><p>

</p><p>Not, however, for Peak, a Chinese sportswear manufacturer and one of many cross-Pacific companies embracing unlikely athletic endorsements. The &ldquo;Delly 1&rdquo; shoe launched in Australia on July 1, 2016, shortly before Matthew signed a four-year, $38 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks.</p><h3 id="in-addition-to-dellavedova-peak-holds-the-sponsorship-rights-of-nba-players-like-l-a-lakers-center-dwight-howard-and-l-a-clippers-guard-lou-williams">In addition to Dellavedova, Peak holds the sponsorship rights of NBA players like L.A. Lakers center Dwight Howard and L.A. Clippers guard Lou Williams.</h3><p>&zwj;And Peak only represents a small part of the apparel pie in China. Fujian-based Anta Sports, which is now the third-largest sportswear manufacturer in the world by revenue, has inked Warriors 3-point maestro Klay Thompson, Celtics forward Gordon Hayward, and journeyman point guard Rajon Rondo. Li-Ning, founded by the gold-medalist gymnast of the same name, has worked directly with Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal and Baron Davis. Together, these companies represent the frontlines of a new schism in the sneaker business. While Nike, Adidas, and Jordan have invested in the lucrative Chinese market for years, local companies are stepping up to compete with the foreigners.</p><p>&ldquo;The ultimate goal is to gain legitimacy within China by creating a more global image and elevating the brand,&rdquo; says Vincenzo La Torre, who covers fashion in Hong Kong and mainland China for the <em>South China Morning Post</em>. &ldquo;Li-Ning in particular has hired designers and consultants from sportswear companies in the West to achieve that goal, but they know that China is their key market, and overseas expansion is only meant to strengthen their presence in China.&rdquo;</p><h3 id="this-sea-change-began-in-2012-when-future-hall-of-famer-dwyane-wade-opted-to-sign-a-10-year-deal-with-li-ning">This sea change began in 2012, when future hall-of-famer Dwyane Wade opted to sign a 10-year deal with Li-Ning.</h3><p>As a result, as shoe scribe Nick DePaula wrote <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22656240/how-dwyane-wade-opened-path-china-young-nba-players" rel="nofollow">in a 2018 ESPN story</a>, Wade opened the door for NBA players to explore their marketing opportunities beyond American shores. Financially, it made great sense on all sides; basketball is the most popular sport in China, and the NBA sends a yearly ambassadors&rsquo; convoy to the country to keep that relationship strong and healthy. Why not set up shop there permanently? Six years after the initial agreement, <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2786663-dwyane-wade-signs-lifetime-deal-with-li-ning-way-of-wade" rel="nofollow">Wade re-upped with Li-Ning for a &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; partnership with the brand</a>. He could&rsquo;ve gone anywhere, and he chose Beijing.</p><p>

</p><p>That same thinking seduced Klay Thompson when his deal was set to expire with Nike. DePaula <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22656240/how-dwyane-wade-opened-path-china-young-nba-players" rel="nofollow">reported</a> that Anta offered him $2 million a year, and a guarantee he&rsquo;d be able to&nbsp; personally design his own line of footwear. That was a hard offer to decline.&zwj;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew with Anta, I would have so much input creatively. I was going to hopefully be the Michael Jordan one day of Anta,&rdquo; Thompson told DePaula, later adding: &ldquo;Knowing that I could be really big in China &mdash; that was really cool to me. The shoe market sometimes is overflooded in the States, and I thought, &lsquo;Well, why not branch out and be global?'&rdquo;</p><h3 id="thompson-has-fulfilled-his-end-of-the-bargain">Thompson has fulfilled his end of the bargain.</h3><p>Some of the Anta shoes bearing his name are truly radical &mdash; <a href="https://www.anktshop.com/anta-klay-thompson-kt4-x-east-bay-times-newspaper-basketball-shoes.html" rel="nofollow">like the newsprint-wrapped KT4s</a> &mdash; which sold out almost immediately when they hit <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/08/klay-thompsons-east-bay-times-themed-shoes-sell-out-quickly/" rel="nofollow">the streets in the East Bay</a>. But despite all of that momentum from some high-profile players, La Torre says that Western manufacturers still rule the roost in China. Nike, in particular, posted a $1.38 billion revenue in Greater China in 2018, the majority of that derived from sneaker sales &mdash;and, given the numerous, billowing Steph Curry banners around downtown Shanghai, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like their push into the mainland will taper off anytime soon.&nbsp;&zwj;</p><p>But Li-Ning doesn&rsquo;t appear to be taking that lying down. &ldquo;What Li-Ning has is a unique brand story and it mirrors China&rsquo;s desire to rise again in the global stage,&rdquo; says Tian Weizhang, who covers the Chinese fashion industry at <em>Women&rsquo;s Wear Daily</em>. &ldquo;Li-Ning has been betting big on fashion and streetwear style with shows in New York and Paris. In this sector, Li-Ning has a smaller gap with global players and the brand knows what ticks with the Chinese audience. And the brand has been learning from Nike and Adidas, by doing designer collaborations with cool brands outside China to build up its desirability among the fashion consumers, making the gap smaller and smaller.&rdquo;</p><h3 id="the-other-movement-working-in-favor-of-chinese-footwear">The other movement working in favor of Chinese footwear?</h3><p>&zwj;The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/business/china-nba-hong-kong-basketball-fans.html" rel="nofollow">roiling tide of patriotism</a> that gripped the mainland following the NBA&rsquo;s Hong Kong flap. For the unaware, last summer Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey made a tweet in support of the pro-democracy protests that had rocked Hong Kong following the proposal of a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50150853" rel="nofollow">dubious, pro-Beijing extradition law</a>. The Chinese Communist Party, which is famously sensitive to any perceived slights directed at its authority by American investors, and is <em>especially </em>sensitive about issues pertaining to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Tibet, quickly denounced the NBA. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-state-tv-cancels-broadcasts-of-nba-preseason-games-and-sponsors-drop-out-in-dispute-over-hong-kong-comments/2019/10/08/28f9dfd4-e9b8-11e9-bafb-da248f8d5734_story.html" rel="nofollow">Games were blacklisted from TV</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/business/nba-china-partners/index.html" rel="nofollow">local sponsorships dropped out</a>, and Morey became a <a href="https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_157178427414591.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces" rel="nofollow">surprising cult figure</a> within Hong Kong activist circles. The NBA did its best to walk back those sentiments, but the damage had been done. CNBC reported that the league stands to lose as much as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/16/nba-will-lose-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-due-to-rift-with-china-commissioner-says.html#:~:text=Silver%20said%20the%20NBA%20could,support%20of%20Hong%20Kong%20protesters." rel="nofollow">$400 million due to cancelled business deals</a>, and in late 2019, <a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/a-chinese-sportswear-companys-stock-is-growing-faster-than-nike-and-adidas/" rel="nofollow">Li-Ning&rsquo;s stock value started to grow a tick faster than Nike&rsquo;s.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/a-chinese-sportswear-companys-stock-is-growing-faster-than-nike-and-adidas/" rel="nofollow">&zwj;</a>According to La Torre, the company has responded by leaning all the way into the fervency. He describes Li-Ning as riding a wave of&nbsp; &ldquo;nationalist fashion&rdquo; &mdash; enjoying its status as one of the premier outfitters for a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3031560/generation-z-china-new-focus-luxury-fashion-brands-which" rel="nofollow">young, energetic, and enthusiastically pro-China wave of young consumers.</a>&nbsp; At a recent exposition at New York Fashion Week, two male models, dressed in revolutionary red, walk down the aisles in windbreakers printed <a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/2135770/chinas-fashion-nationalism-li-nings-red-yellow-sportswear" rel="nofollow">with the Mandarin characters for &ldquo;Middle Kingdom.&rdquo;</a> Feng Chan Wang, a renowned Beijing designer, offered a white T-shirt with block lettering that reads, &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo; &mdash; reclaiming the frequently-derisively-uttered phrase&nbsp; into a point of pride. In general, La Torre doesn&rsquo;t expect the Hong Kong controversy to have a particularly pervasive effect on the relationship between Chinese consumers and foreign manufacturers, but it remains emblematic of the unexpected tensions of a globalized market: American athletes signed to a brand that&rsquo;s riding off of a lucrative, distinctly non-American message.</p><h3 id="western-sneakerheads-dont-buy-a-lot-of-chinese-shoes">Western sneakerheads don&rsquo;t buy a lot of Chinese shoes.</h3><p>&zwj;That isn&rsquo;t necessarily for a lack of trying; the availability just isn&rsquo;t there. Walk into any FootLocker, and you&rsquo;re not going to see many Antas or Li-Nings in stock. &ldquo;Retailers in the US would rather push Nike or Adidas,&rdquo; explains Drew Whitcomb, who runs the sneaker reviews hub WearTesters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s annoying for the fans of the players.&rdquo;</p><p>Instead, when Whitcomb needs to get Chinese products in hand for critical purposes, he typically either reaches out directly to the distributors, or relies on a few online storefronts he trusts. WearTesters has reviewed hundreds of foreign shoes on its YouTube channel, and Whitcomb says those videos generally do pretty well for him both due to his company&rsquo;s sizable foothold in Asia, as well as general curiosity. The scarcity of these shoes in the West has engendered a certain obsession in sneaker-collecting corners, though some Chinese companies are beginning to&nbsp; streamline the process of shipping their footwear overseas. Li-Ning recently broke ground on an Amazon shop, allowing Wade fans all over the world to take home <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/3A2E95E4-7426-4CD3-825C-C766EE6C0D76?ingress=0&amp;visitId=2d521f29-fe61-488a-a9f7-4f563051033d" rel="nofollow">the WoW 8s</a>. For his part, Whitcomb believes that Chinese manufacturers stack up with any other sneaker brand in the world. &ldquo;The materials they use to build their shoes are basically the same as the US brands,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The vast majority of the world&rsquo;s shoes are built right there in China, so the expertise is there.&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, Whitcomb says, the only noticeable difference an American customer might find in a pair of Delly 1s is some added attention to the realities of basketball culture in China. 300 million people in the country play the game, and most do not have access to indoor hardwood courts. As such, Chinese basketball shoes are built with an extra-durable layer of rubber on the outsole, so they can hold up against weather, heat, and the hard concrete of playground hoops. (They also tend to be built a little bit wider, matching the most common foot shape in east Asia.) But those are all superficial concerns. Considering that Klay Thompson wears his Antas during every game he plays in the Chase Center, clearly, Chinese footwear has been thoroughly NBA-tested.</p><p>If these Chinese brands do eventually make a full-on push into the American market, it would be a big further step in what seems to be a greater economic trend sweeping the country. As China continues to consolidate influence as a global superpower, its business leaders have opened up factories and biotech labs in the US. As of last year, China <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/chinese-investment-in-the-united-states-database/#:~:text=Total%20Chinese%20investment%20in%20the,mark%20for%20inbound%20Chinese%20investment." rel="nofollow">has put $145 billion into the American domestic product</a>. Who&rsquo;s to say that fashion can&rsquo;t be next?</p><p>

<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.

<b>OPEN TO THE PUBLIC INVESTING, INC.</b></p>

<p>Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds (except for Treasuries offered through your Jiko Account) are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.  Additional information about Public Investing can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered.  Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured.  Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits. Additional information about SIPC can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.  Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Margin-Disclosure-Statement-2024.09.19.pdf">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Apex-Margin-and-Short-Account-Agreement.pdf">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-ira">Individual Retirement Accounts</b><br />
Self-directed individual retirement accounts are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Information about retirement accounts on Public is for educational purposes only and is not tax or investment advice. Consult your tax advisor for individual considerations. Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="../disclosures/Open-to-the-Public-Investing-Inc.-Fixed-Income-Disclosure.pdf">fixed income</a> and <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Apex-Fractional-Bond-Disclosure-1.pdf">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="../disclosures/Bond-Account-Disclosure-1.pdf">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> to learn more. </p>
<p>
<b>Fractional Shares</b><br />
Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable. For a complete explanation of conditions, restrictions and limitations associated with fractional shares, see our <a href="../disclosures/Fractional-Shares-Trading-Disclosure-03.21.2024.pdf">Fractional Share Disclosure</a> to learn more. </p>
<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

<b>JIKO SECURITIES, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Jiko Accounts</b><br />
Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
