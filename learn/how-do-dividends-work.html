When a public company is doing financially well or wants to promote shareholder interest, it may reward stockholders with dividends.</p><p>Companies usually pay dividends quarterly or semiannually, though it depends on the stock at hand how frequently (or not) this happens.</p><p>You can find out if a company pays dividends and how much they pay by looking at the dividend yield. This is usually one of the key metrics on a basic stock chart.</p>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="how-do-dividends-work">How do dividends work?</h2><p>Dividends are regular payments that companies make to shareholders, usually from their profits. When you own a dividend-paying stock, you receive these payments, often quarterly, as a way to share in the company&rsquo;s financial success.</p><p>The dividend amount is set per share, so if a company declares a $2 annual dividend and you own 50 shares, you&rsquo;ll receive $100. Many companies in sectors like utilities, finance, and consumer goods offer stable dividends, making them attractive for income-focused investors.</p><p>Investors can opt to reinvest dividends automatically through Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIP), which help compound growth by buying more shares with the dividend payout. <a href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public.com</a> offers the option to reinvest dividends automatically.</p><p>You can enable dividend reinvestment by following steps:</p><ul>
<li>Go to your account settings on Public.com.</li>
<li>Turn on the option to automatically reinvest your dividends.</li>
</ul><p>This strategy helps you accumulate more shares and grow your future dividend payouts.</p><p>Dividends can offer a steady income stream while potentially benefiting from stock price appreciation, making them a key part of a balanced investment strategy.</p>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="dividend-paying-companies">Dividend paying companies&nbsp;</h2><p>Dividend-paying companies are typically well-established businesses with stable earnings and a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. Many of these companies are found in sectors like <b>utilities, consumer goods, healthcare, real estate,</b> and <b>financial services</b>, where consistent cash flow enables them to distribute regular dividends.</p><p>Key characteristics of dividend-paying companies include:</p><ul>
<li><b>Strong financial health</b>: These companies often have healthy balance sheets and reliable cash flows, allowing them to maintain or even grow their dividend payments over time.</li>
<li><b>Dividend growth</b>: Many companies increase their dividend payouts annually, making them attractive for investors seeking both income and long-term capital appreciation.</li>
<li><b>Blue-chip stocks</b>: Large, established companies like those in the <b>S&amp;P 500</b> are common dividend payers, offering stability and lower risk.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="why-buy-dividend-stocks">Why buy dividend stocks?</h2><p>Many investors use dividends as a form of passive income. The only prerequisite of receiving a dividend is being a shareholder of a dividend-paying company.</p><p>The caveat? Public companies may use dividends to court investors even when the stock price is decreasing.</p><p>Additionally, these companies are not required to pay dividends to shareholders. A company&rsquo;s board of directors can decide to issue, cut back on, or eliminate dividends at any time. This is true even for stocks with consistent dividend payouts over a period of years or decades.</p><p>Still, dividend income is a legitimate income stream. Just remember that past performance is not an indicator of future results.</p><p>Explore <a href="../markets/highest-dividend-yield.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high yield dividend stocks</a> and understand the reasons behind investing in dividend stocks; check out a list of public companies offering dividend yields of 3% or higher, providing valuable insights into the potential benefits of dividend investing.</p>

	<h3>Here are a few reasons investors might choose to buy dividend stocks:</h3><ul><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><li>
<p>Steady income from regular dividend payments.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Potential for capital appreciation alongside dividends.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Lower risk due to stability and less volatility.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Compounding growth through reinvested dividends.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Hedge against inflation with rising dividends.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sign of company strength and financial health.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tax advantages for qualified dividends.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Portfolio diversification with income-generating assets.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Downside protection during market downturns.</p>
</li>
</ul></section><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="why-do-companies-pay-dividends">Why do companies pay dividends?</h2><p>Companies pay dividends to distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders, providing them with a regular income stream. This is especially common for mature companies with stable cash flows and fewer opportunities for reinvestment into rapid growth.</p><p>You may also see them in certain stocks that fall under the category of blue chip. <a href="https://public.com/learn/what-are-blue-chip-stocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue-chip stocks</a> are public companies that are huge, mature, and have a solid reputation.</p><h3 id="key-reasons-companies-pay-dividends-include">Key reasons companies pay dividends include:</h3><ul>
<li>Attracting and retaining investors: Dividends appeal to income-focused investors, particularly during uncertain market conditions, offering steady returns in addition to potential stock appreciation.</li>
<li>Confidence in financial stability: Regular dividend payments signal strong financial health, showing that the company is consistently profitable and has a reliable cash flow.</li>
<li>Rewarding long-term shareholders: Dividends help build shareholder loyalty, encouraging long-term holding of shares, even in volatile markets.</li>
</ul><p>While dividend payments are often a good sign, it is important to note that extremely high dividend payments could be a red flag. Higher dividend payouts are difficult to sustain over a long period, so a person who invests in a company with high dividends accepts the risk of the company cutting back or eliminating payments at any time (as well as the natural risk of value loss in any stock).</p>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="why-some-companies-do-not-pay-dividends">Why some companies do not pay dividends?</h2><p>Not all companies pay dividends, particularly those in growth-focused industries. Instead of returning profits to shareholders, these companies reinvest earnings back into the business to fuel expansion, innovation, and acquisitions.</p><h3 id="the-primary-reasons-some-companies-choose-not-to-pay-dividends-include">
The primary reasons some companies choose not to pay dividends include:</h3><ul>
<li>Focus on growth: Companies in sectors like tech and biotech often prioritize reinvesting profits to accelerate growth, develop new products, or expand market share, believing it will deliver greater long-term returns.</li>
<li>Early stage or high growth: Startups or companies in their early stages often hold back on dividends, opting to reinvest all available resources into scaling their operations and increasing stock value.</li>
<li>Stock buybacks: Some companies prefer stock buybacks, using excess cash to repurchase shares, which can boost the stock price and benefit investors by increasing earnings per share (EPS).</li>
<li>Volatility or uncertain cash flow: Companies in volatile industries may retain earnings as a buffer against economic fluctuations, ensuring they have sufficient capital for future investments or downturns.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="how-often-are-dividends-paid-out-and-how-do-shareholders-receive-them">How often are dividends paid out, and how do shareholders receive them?</h2><p>The timing of a dividend payout differs from company to company. The most common cadence is quarterly. Some Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT pronounced reets) pay dividends monthly.</p><p>Jargon alert!</p><p>A declaration date is the date a company announces it will distribute dividends to investors.</p><p>An ex-dividend date (aka ex-date) is the set deadline for dividend payouts to existing shareholders. The company owes dividends to any shareholders who buy the stock before that date. The company does not owe dividends to any shareholders who buy the stock on or after the ex-date.</p><p>The payment date is when the company actually distributes dividend payouts.</p><p>A dividend payment can come in two forms:</p><h3 id="1-stock">1. Stock:</h3><p>A stock dividend pays an investor with additional shares of stock. For example, if an investor owns 20 shares of a company that pays a 5% stock dividend, the investor will receive 1 additional share as an annual dividend payment (5% of 20 = 1).</p><h3 id="2-cash">2. Cash:</h3><p>A cash dividend pays investors with cash. For example, if an investor owns 20 shares at $10 each ($200 in total value) and the company offers a 5% cash dividend, the investor will receive $10 as an annual dividend payment (5% of $200 is $10).</p><p>For both stock and cash dividend payouts, you will receive the dividend payment on the payout date in your brokerage account. Some people choose to pocket dividends, but some people choose to reinvest their dividend payments back into the company.</p><p>The way a dividend is paid out may depend on what class of stock you own (aka preferred or common stock). As the name implies, preferred stock shareholders have priority over common stock shareholders. Preferred dividend stockholders usually receive their dividends earlier than common stockholders.</p><p>Did you know? If a company decides to skip a dividend payment they may be obligated to pay back this dividend in the future to preferred stock shareholders. They do not have this obligation to common stock shareholders.</p>
</div><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="understanding-the-dividend-payout-ratio">Understanding the dividend payout ratio</h2><p>The dividend payout ratio, aka dividend yield, shows you the proportion of the <a href="https://public.com/learn/what-is-an-earnings-call" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&rsquo;s earnings</a> that the company pays out to shareholders as a dividend.</p><p>The dividend yield you see on a stock chart looks like a percentage (for example, some dividend-paying companies <a href="what-is-the-sp-500.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the S&amp;P 500</a> may have <a href="https://www.dividend.com/how-to-invest/comparing-dividend-stock-sectors-by-yield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dividend yields around 25%</a>, depending on the company and sector).</p>
</div>
<section class="wgt-addon count-1 style-example list-style-bullet">

	<h3>Here’s a simple equation to remember the dividend payout ratio:</h3><ul><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends Paid / Net Income</strong></p>
</li>
</ul></section><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="special-dividends-vs-regular-dividends">Special dividends vs. Regular dividends</h2><p>Most dividends are regular, meaning companies pay them out on a consistent cadence. But that&rsquo;s not always the case.</p><p>A special dividend is a non-recurring dividend. It may only be a one-time event and is not suggestive of long-term dividend payouts. You can find out if a dividend announcement is special or regular by looking up a stocks <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/dividend-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dividend history on the Nasdaq website</a>.</p>

</section><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><h2 id="should-you-automatically-reinvest-dividends">Should you automatically reinvest dividends?</h2><p>Whether or not you want to automatically reinvest your dividend payouts into the company is up to you. Many investors will select this option if the stock shows signs of long-term growth. It can be an effective way to get compounded returns, aka cumulative growth from a series of gains and reinvestments.</p><p>The process of automatically reinvesting dividends is also called a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP).</p><p>Did you know? The Public app offers automated dividend reinvestment. When you use this feature, we&rsquo;ll invest any dividends you receive right back into the company that paid it out.

The IRS usually applies long-term capital gains to investments held for a year or more.</p><p>But it treats dividends differently.</p><p>Whether a cash dividend is qualified or non-qualified will determine what tax structure will apply.</p><p>A dividend is considered qualified if common stock is held for a minimum of 60 days or preferred stock is held for a minimum of 90 days before the ex-dividend date.</p><p>If a dividend is qualified, it is subject to the long-term capital gains tax rate, which is considerably less than the federal income tax rate. If a dividend is non-qualified, the capital gains tax does not apply, and it is subject to the investor&rsquo;s ordinary income tax rate (which depends on their tax bracket).</p><p>The long-term capital gains tax rate can either be 0%, 15%, or 20% based on your annual income and marital status, whereas the federal income tax rate can fall anywhere between 10% and 37%. Within any income and marital bracket, a person will earn more after a long-term capital gains tax than they would after a federal income tax. For the diligent investor, dividends can provide great tax opportunities.</p><p>Even if you receive dividends in the form of stock or automatically reinvest your dividends, you still must pay taxes.

Before investing, consider your investment objectives, all fees and expenses, and any potential conflicts of interest.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/public-customer-relationship-summary">Form CRS</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>, and other disclosures.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections are provided for informational and illustrative purposes, and may not reflect actual future performance.</p>
<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>.</p>

<b>OPEN TO THE PUBLIC INVESTING, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Securities, Options, and Bonds.</b></p>
<p>Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds (except for Treasuries offered through your Jiko Account) are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.  Additional information about Public Investing can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered.  Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured.  Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits. Additional information about SIPC can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.  Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Margin-Disclosure-Statement-2024.09.19.pdf">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Apex-Margin-and-Short-Account-Agreement.pdf">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-ira">Individual Retirement Accounts</b><br />
Self-directed individual retirement accounts are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Information about retirement accounts on Public is for educational purposes only and is not tax or investment advice. Consult your tax advisor for individual considerations. Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="../disclosures/Open-to-the-Public-Investing-Inc.-Fixed-Income-Disclosure.pdf">fixed income</a> and <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Apex-Fractional-Bond-Disclosure-1.pdf">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="../disclosures/Bond-Account-Disclosure-1.pdf">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> to learn more. </p>
<p>
<b>Fractional Shares</b><br />
Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable. For a complete explanation of conditions, restrictions and limitations associated with fractional shares, see our <a href="../disclosures/Fractional-Shares-Trading-Disclosure-03.21.2024.pdf">Fractional Share Disclosure</a> to learn more. </p>
<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

<b>JIKO SECURITIES, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Jiko Accounts</b><br />
Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
