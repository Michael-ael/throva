Since almost all NFTs are sold on the Ethereum blockchain, you&rsquo;ll need to choose a compatible wallet and fill it with ETH currency. There are two main wallets to consider:</p>

<figure class="wgt-image">
	<img width="300" height="54" src="../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-4.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="Coinbase is similarly accepted by most all NFT marketplaces, and can be used either as a desktop extension or a mobile phone app." loading="lazy" decoding="async" /></figure><div class="entry-content"><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/plp/nar3?utm_source=google_search_b&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=1711534994&amp;utm_content=68048698078&amp;utm_term=coinbase&amp;utm_creative=579139914226&amp;utm_device=c&amp;utm_placement=&amp;utm_network=g&amp;utm_location=9004342&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA3rKQBhCNARIsACUEW_YZkoJDZrTv1hBWkNt4rsklOCQtNJeHu6wuUaE2u9EhSSv_Qy5L0ocaAhd9EALw_wcB" rel="nofollow">Coinbase</a> is similarly accepted by most all NFT marketplaces, and can be used either as a desktop extension or a mobile phone app. The big difference here is that Coinbase also works with Bitcoin, so if you&rsquo;re looking to take a wider approach to crypto investing, Coinbase may be right for you. However, a few marketplaces are currently not working with Coinbase, so if you want to maximize your NFT options it may not be the way to go. <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/wallet?clickId=1j4XZbUHzxyIUpj1wW34mUdNUkGRVtTto2GT380&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=growthp&amp;utm_campaign=rt_p_m_w_d_acq_imp_gro_aff_Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;utm_content=552039&amp;utm_creative=Online%20Tracking%20Link&amp;irgwc=1" rel="nofollow">Download Coinbase&rsquo;s extension here</a>.</p><p>The process of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22809090/nft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to" rel="nofollow">setting up your wallets</a> works largely the same way as setting up an account on any website, with a few key differences. Both MetaMask and Coinbase will give you a &ldquo;seed phrase,&rdquo; which is 12 random words. It&rsquo;s very important not to lose this. The seed phrase is the only way to recover your account if you want to use your wallet on a new device or if you uninstall the browser/app and need to get back in. Copy your seed phrase down and store it in a highly secure location. Consider saving it with a password manager and also writing it down and keeping the record in a physical safe. You don&rsquo;t want to be one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html" rel="nofollow">lost crypto millionaires</a> who are permanently locked out of their wallets. If you lose your password and/or security phrase, neither MetaMask nor Coinbase can do anything to recover your account. There is no &ldquo;forgot password&rdquo; feature in the world of crypto.</p><p>Once you have your wallet set up, loading it with ETH is pretty simple and works more or less like buying anything else online. If you find yourself wanting an expert to hold your hand through the entire wallet/coin purchase process (no shame! this is an important step) here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw-tQD0jztE" rel="nofollow">MetaMask tutorial video</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCALVu58fKk" rel="nofollow">Coinbase Wallet guide video</a>.</p><p>Note of caution: you can sometimes also buy Ethereum using a crypto exchange like Binance, Kraken, Gemini, or even Coinbase&rsquo;s exchange (vs. Coinbase Wallet). However, these are far less likely to work on NFT marketplaces. Also, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/" rel="nofollow">Ethereum warns against exchanges</a> because they are more vulnerable to hackers than wallets.</p><h2 id="can-you-buy-an-nft-without-ethereum">Can you buy an NFT without Ethereum?</h2><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/coinbase-to-allow-nft-purchases-without-crypto-via-mastercard#:~:text=cards%20%2D%2D%20without%20having%20to%20own%20cryptocurrency.&amp;text=Under%20the%20partnership%2C%20Mastercard%20will,supported%20with%20just%20debit%20cards." rel="nofollow">Yes</a>. As of a few months ago, many (but not all!) marketplaces have begun accepting Visa and <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2022/coinbase-nft-marketplace-making-it-easier-for-everyone-to-buy-nfts/" rel="nofollow">Mastercard</a>. This is a complete game-changer, making NFTs more available than ever before.</p><p>There are a few things to be aware of when buying an <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/buying-nfts-with-credit-card/" rel="nofollow">NFT with fiat currency</a>. First, many credit card companies consider crypto purchases to be a &ldquo;cash advance.&rdquo; This affects your NFT purchase, because technically when a platform lets you pay with a credit card what&rsquo;s really happening is that you&rsquo;re buying the agreed-upon amount of ETH in that moment, facilitated through the marketplace or credit card company, which is then used to purchase the NFT. So if you&rsquo;re charging your next CryptoPunk, be prepared to shell out for cash advance interest rates and fees. You may want to check these out with your credit card company ahead of time. You also likely won&rsquo;t rack up cash back, points, or miles for your purchase.</p><p>Secondly, no matter how you pay, <strong>you&rsquo;ll still need an ETH compatible crypto wallet</strong>. Your wallet holds your NFT once it&rsquo;s yours, so there&rsquo;s no skipping that step&hellip;yet. Innovation is happening quickly for NFTs, which were only invented in 2015, so there&rsquo;s no ruling out what the future will hold.</p><p>What about Bitcoin? Good question. The answer is&hellip;technically yes? Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain does not have the capability to handle NFT sales, mainly lacking Ethereum&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/smart-contracts" rel="nofollow">smart contracts</a>,&rdquo; feature. However, a new blockchain called <a href="https://decrypt.co/82891/bitcoin-nfts-stacks-blockchain" rel="nofollow">Stacks</a> has recently popped up that can handle NFT sales, and is facilitating buying with Bitcoin. However, their NFTs just haven&rsquo;t popped off. The sales numbers and options are comparatively miniscule, so you can certainly buy a Stacks NFT for less moolah, but it&rsquo;ll be more difficult to sell. When people talk about NFTs, they&rsquo;re talking about ETH-backed ones. Still, Stacks may be a good space to watch.</p><h2 id="choosing-your-nft-marketplaces">Choosing your NFT marketplaces</h2><p>OK, now you&rsquo;ve got your wallet and you&rsquo;re ready to buy an NFT! The next step is to check out some marketplaces, think Amazon for NFTs. Most marketplaces will facilitate both direct purchases and auctions, depending on the seller&rsquo;s prerogative. Here&rsquo;s an overview of the most notable options.</p>

It&rsquo;s generally considered eBay for NFTs because it supports both auctions and fixed-price sales, and there&rsquo;s something for everyone. It&rsquo;s a great place to start and is user friendly for browsing in different categories or price points. It also supports creators minting directly on the platform. Another plus for using OpenSea as a newbie NFT buyer is that because it&rsquo;s the largest and has been around the longest, there are a lot of online resources to help you navigate the marketplace. For instance, one question you&rsquo;ll run into when buying an NFT is who pays gas fees&mdash;a fee all users must pay to perform any function on the Ethereum blockchain that contributes to transaction authentication. There are video tutorials to help you understand, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj-OgSlX2UE" rel="nofollow">even avoid gas fees</a> on OpenSea. OpenSea accepts over 150 cryptocurrencies.</p>

The difference is it is a little less popular and a little smaller, which can be a good thing if there is less competition on an auction you&rsquo;re interested in&mdash;though it means fewer options to browse as well. <a href="https://www.finder.com/opensea-vs-rarible" rel="nofollow">The key difference</a> between Rarible and OpenSea is that Rarible allows creators to set up to a 30% royalty on their sales, whereas OpenSea caps royalties at 10%. This number affects how you re-sell or make money from the NFT you&rsquo;re purchasing. Rarible is home to a few fun brands getting into the NFT space like <a href="https://rarible.com/tacobell" rel="nofollow">Taco Bell</a>. Rarible is also backed by its own blockchain, as opposed to OpenSea which is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Due to this, Rarible has its own cryptocurrency RARI, which it allows marketplace members to earn through routinely using the platform. So if you have the time to commit to being a full-fledged community member, earning RARI will allow you to vote on platform upgrades to shape the future of the Rarible community.</p>

Unlike OpenSea and Rarible, SuperRare only accepts ETH. The marketplace offers both primary (meaning NFTs are minted directly on SuperRare) and resale options, and due to its prominence in the art world, watching the SuperRare space to get original works when they first drop can be especially valuable. One more thing that sets SuperRare apart: the platform allows collectors (aka you, the buyer) to make passive income through <a href="https://medium.com/superrare/the-art-royalty-revolution-6c0d13a6912a" rel="nofollow">royalties starting at 1%</a> of every re-sale. This can be a huge pro for buying an NFT from SuperRare, since other platforms only allocate royalties to creators.</p>

Investors can purchase via an IPO primary market or from other platform users on a secondary trading market.</p><p>There are more crypto-native methods of fractionally investing in NFTs as well. An NFT can be deposited into a locked up NFT vault, with ERC-20s (sets of fungible tokens on the Ethereum network) then minted to represent fractional ownership of the NFT. When someone purchases one of these ERC-20 tokens, they purchase a share of the NFT. <a href="https://fractional.art/" rel="nofollow">Fractional.art</a> was the first platform to offer fractional investing in this fashion, and explains in more detail <a href="https://medium.com/fractional-art/what-is-fractional-dd4f86e6458a" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>Recently, investment DAO&rsquo;s have also been created, such as <a href="https://apedao-assets.vercel.app/" rel="nofollow">ApeDAO</a>, which gives members collective ownership of 81 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs (though the DAO has been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dao-amassed-trove-bored-ape-165834240.html" rel="nofollow">struggling with valuation gaps</a> recently).</p><p>A Twitter thread by Richard Chen, general partner at a cryptocurrency investment firm, lists <a href="https://twitter.com/richardchen39/status/1492260662403284996" rel="nofollow">prediction markets and derivatives</a> as another way to gain exposure to blue chip NFTs, and summarizes some pros and cons of all these methods.</p><h2 id="risks-to-buying-nfts">Risks to buying NFTs</h2><p>Like with any investment, there are a few risks to be aware of before buying an NFT.</p><p>First, beware copy-cat NFTs posing as popular tokens. Look for verified sellers on marketplaces (OpenSea&rsquo;s verification looks similar to Instagram&rsquo;s blue checkmark symbol) to avoid scams. A good example is <a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyApeYC/status/1467946301748748292" rel="nofollow">PAYC</a>&mdash;a series that takes the most popular NFTs, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and sells exact copies of the images, but mirrored.

The world of NFTs is rife with fraudulent sites that try to entice potential buyers to connect their wallets, only to use the connection to steal the wallet holder&rsquo;s cryptocurrency and NFTs. The world of crypto is particularly unforgiving once a bad actor executes a theft, so a good rule of thumb is: if you think there&rsquo;s even a chance something might not be legit, stay away.</p><p>Finally, like any popular investment, there is always a possibility that we&rsquo;re in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/crypto-investors-see-an-nft-bubble-but-tout-power-of-underlying-tech.html" rel="nofollow">NFT bubble</a> that could burst, leaving your NFT worth less than you bought it for. This is pretty par for any market, but you&rsquo;ll want to educate yourself on what <a href="https://unherd.com/thepost/the-nft-bubble-will-burst/#:~:text=The%20NFT%20(non%2Dfungible%20token,rapidly%20inflating%20one%20at%20that." rel="nofollow">experts think about the space</a> before you buy.</p>

	<h3>A note on the environmental impact</h3><ul><?xml encoding="UTF-8"><li>
<p>Like many cryptocurrencies, Ethereum relies on a security system called &ldquo;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/" rel="nofollow">proof of work</a>&rdquo; that requires an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change" rel="nofollow">enormous amount of energy to pull off</a>. &ldquo;Mining,&rdquo; or verifying transactions within POW, is purposefully energy guzzling, and has been successful in deterring hackers. It also means that the Ethereum blockchain literally burns through more electricity than some small countries. Experts estimate <a href="https://earth.org/nfts-environmental-impact/" rel="nofollow">the carbon footprint of a single ETH transaction</a> to be 74,000X that of a Visa Card transaction. Your increased carbon footprint is just something to be aware of when buying NFTs.</p>

<b>All investments</b> involve the risk of loss and the past performance of a security or a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.

<b>PUBLIC ADVISORS LLC</b></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investment advisory services for Treasury Accounts are provided by Public Advisors LLC (“Public Advisors”), an SEC-registered investment adviser.  Brokerage services are provided by Public Investing (see below).  Public Advisors and Public Investing are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”), and both subsidiaries charge a fee for their respective Treasury Account services.  Before investing, consider your investment objectives, all fees and expenses, and any potential conflicts of interest.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/public-customer-relationship-summary">Form CRS</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>, and other disclosures.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections are provided for informational and illustrative purposes, and may not reflect actual future performance.</p>
<p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk.  Although Treasuries are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment.  Early withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact returns.  Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in different yields.  As a general rule, the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for these risks and your overall investment objectives.  For more details, see Public Advisors’ <a href="../disclosures/Public-Advisors-Form-ADV-Part-2A-01.31.2025.pdf">Form ADV Part 2A</a>.</p>

Additional information about Public Investing can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered.  Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured.  Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits.

<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.  Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date.  Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics.  See <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees. Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="../disclosures/Options-Order-Flow-Rebate-Program-TCs-06.03.2025.pdf">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates range from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on the underlying security, whether the trade was placed via API, and your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile.  Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”).  As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin.  Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.  Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Margin-Disclosure-Statement-2024.09.19.pdf">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="../disclosures/Apex-Margin-and-Short-Account-Agreement.pdf">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing.  Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="../disclosures/APEX-High-Yield-Cash-Account-Bank-Partners-List-01.06.2025.pdf">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks.  Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing.  Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="../disclosures/HIGH-YIELD-CASH-ACCOUNT-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-Effective-October-3-2024.pdf">Learn more</a>.</p>

Self-directed individual retirement accounts are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Information about retirement accounts on Public is for educational purposes only and is not tax or investment advice. Consult your tax advisor for individual considerations. Visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">IRS website</a> for more information on the limitations and tax benefits of Traditional and Roth IRAs. All investing involves risk.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">IRA Match Program</a>, Public Investing will fund a 1% match of:  (a) all IRA transfers and 401(k) rollovers made to your Public IRA; and (b) all contributions made to your Public IRA up to the annual contribution limit. The matched funds must be kept in the IRA account for at least 5 years to avoid an early removal fee. See full terms of the Program <a href="../disclosures/Public-IRA-Match-Program-Terms-Conditions-06.30.2025.pdf">here</a>. Rate and terms are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal.  In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing.  Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds.  The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees.  A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here.  The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.  Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
<p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="../disclosures/Open-to-the-Public-Investing-Inc.-Fixed-Income-Disclosure.pdf">fixed income</a> and <a href="../disclosures/OTTP-Apex-Fractional-Bond-Disclosure-1.pdf">fractional bonds</a>.

<p><b>Trading Commissions</b><br />
Commission-free trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the U.S. Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing.  Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a> to learn more. </p>
<p>
<b>Fractional Shares</b><br />
Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable. For a complete explanation of conditions, restrictions and limitations associated with fractional shares, see our <a href="../disclosures/Fractional-Shares-Trading-Disclosure-03.21.2024.pdf">Fractional Share Disclosure</a> to learn more. </p>
<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans</b><br />
Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs.  Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.  Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations.  Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile.  You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan.  Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.  See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure.</p>

<b>JIKO SECURITIES, INC.</b></p>
<p><b>Jiko Accounts</b><br />
Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>, provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s  <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by Public Investing and advised by Public Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
<p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Jiko Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a href="../disclosures/treasuries_risk_disclosure.pdf">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 115%;">Investments in T-bills: Not FDIC Insured; No Bank Guarantee; May Lose Value.</b></p>
