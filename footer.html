                    <p>Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves risks, including but not limited
                        to, interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk. Although Treasuries are considered safer
                        than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or part of your investment. Early
                        withdrawal or sale prior to maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact
                        returns. Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market conditions and may result in

                        Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Options
                        investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur
                        permanent loss by expiration date. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and
                        costs. Investors must read and understand the <a

                        Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed
                        information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk
                        profile. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website. All investments involve risks,
                        including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no
                        guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an
                        investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
                    <p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the
                        Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the
                        Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, shareholders do not have the
                        protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the
                        1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA. The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not
                        reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased
                        bitcoin. Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the
                        right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin. Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly
                        speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market
                        manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>

                        Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses,
                        including loss of more than your initial investment. Please assess your investment objectives,
                        risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.
                        You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you
                        purchased. throva Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without
                        prior notice. If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance
                        requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities. If you are unable to
                        do so, throva Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or
                        notice. You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. For more information

                    <p><b>Bonds.</b><br />
                        “Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the
                        throva platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at throva Investing and custodied
                        at Apex Clearing. For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in your
                        Jiko Account, as explained under the “Jiko Account” section.</p>
                    <p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates,
                        credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events,
                        tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior
                        to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond
                        prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower
                        credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject
                        to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are
                        third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.
                        Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address
                        the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
                    <p><b>Bond Accounts</b><br />
                        A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with throva Investing. Deposits into this
                        account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield
                        is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before
                        fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s
                        YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be
                        different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less
                        than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if
                        the issuer defaults on the bond. throva Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our
                        <a href="disclosures/throva-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
                    <p>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in
                        the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate
                        each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be
                        rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</p>
                    <p>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on throva and
                        cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a

                        provides accounts (“Jiko Accounts”) offering 6-month US Treasury Bills (“T-bills”). See JSI’s <a

                            rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information. For the avoidance
                        of doubt, a Jiko Account is different and separate from the Treasury Account offered by throva
                        Investing and advised by throva Advisors (see “Treasury Accounts” section above). </p>
                    <p>JSI uses funds from your Jiko Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the
                        T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the
                        T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount
                        price.” Aggregate funds in your Jiko Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in
                        your Jiko Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less
                        than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change
                        and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future
                        performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest
                        rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to
                        changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial
                        instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See <a
