Known for their low volatility and high-yields, they might not be the “coolest” stocks on the block, but they can get the job done for investors looking to generate passive income. Dividend stocks can be attractive during periods of market volatility, and in bear markets, because the yields paid out to investors can help preserve the value of the stock by mitigating sell-offs. When researching dividend stocks, many investors will favor companies that they feel can meet the needs of high-yield payouts and do not have a history of cutting dividends.

For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade.

The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

for Brookfield Renewable's stock appears negative due to several financial indicators reflecting operational challenges. Operating margins experienced a slight decline, attributed to expected dilution from the NFP acquisition, and there are projected reductions in earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the upcoming years, signaling potential profitability concerns. Additionally, softening demand in various sectors, combined with reduced investor sentiment and adjustments to revenue guidance below consensus, contributes to an overall unfavorable financial assessment for the company."],"bullsSay":["Brookfield Renewable benefits from significant energy demand growth driven by major tech advancements and the increasing reliance on cloud computing, leading to a robust 75% increase in datacenter orders and a substantial backlog. The company's diverse global portfolio, which exceeds 20 gigawatts of installed capacity across various clean energy technologies, positions it favorably to capitalize on the strong demand for renewables, particularly from the U.S. market, supported by premium electricity prices for its hydroelectric assets and long-term power contracts.

\u0026 Johnson's stock outlook is negatively influenced by anticipated lower organic revenue growth, primarily stemming from the pharmaceutical division's diminishing contributions due to upcoming loss of exclusivity for key drugs and challenges in the drug pipeline. The MedTech division faces competitive pressures, and there are concerns regarding its ability to achieve substantial growth, especially in surgical robotics.

The company's expanding product pipeline, including promising therapies like Carvykti, Tecvayli, and Spravato, reinforces its revenue growth and margin enhancement potential, as demonstrated by substantial clinical remission rates in its treatment trials.

anticipates declines in key financial metrics, as core aerospace margins are projected to decrease by approximately 100 basis points, with organic sales in the Industrial Automation segment expected to fall in the -Low Single Digits percentage range year-over-year in 2025. The company's adjusted sales guidance for Q4 2024 reflects a reduction of $400 million, translating to a shift from previous growth expectations of 2% to 4% to a projected range of -2% to flat growth, indicating potential ongoing challenges in the aerospace sector. Additionally, segment margins have contracted by 350 basis points year-over-year to 20.9%, signaling possible pressure on earnings per share with estimates suggesting a downside to approximately $9.60 for 2025 if growth remains lackluster and margins do not improve."],"bullsSay":["Honeywell has demonstrated consistent margin improvement over the past decade, with margins recently achieving new highs, which reflects the company's financial strength and operational efficiency. The firm's focus on organic sales growth has been evident, as it reported a 2% year-over-year increase, significantly outperforming consensus estimates, while segment margins are projected to rise by 60-100 basis points in 2025 despite some cost inflation. Additionally, Honeywell's strategic alignment with secular growth trends, particularly in the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment, positions it well for sustained revenue growth, bolstered by

experienced an 11% decline in stock value, primarily attributed to disappointing broadband unit growth, leading to an adjustment in fiscal year 2025 earnings per share (EPS) expectations from $4.37 to $4.21, with a projected flat growth in adjusted EBITDA of $38 billion. Additionally, the forecast now anticipates a net loss of 506,000 broadband subscribers by 2025, worsening from an earlier projection of a loss of 322,000, which further decreases the EPS estimate for fiscal year 2026 from $4.95 to $4.74. Margins are likely to be pressured due to investments in theme parks and marketing costs, combined with potential revenue declines stemming from a shift in pricing strategy, leading to concerns about average revenue per user growth and resulting in a reevaluation of Comcast's fair valuation."],"bullsSay":["Comcast demonstrated strong financial performance with a 10% increase in total adjusted EBITDA, reaching $8.8 billion, highlighting robust revenue generation capabilities. The company's wireless segment achieved 307,000 net additions, marking a 12% penetration of its customer base, which contributes positively to its overall growth strategy.

outlook remains negative due to several fundamental concerns, including elevated valuation metrics, declining revenue estimates, and intensified competition in both core and non-core markets. The company experienced significant downward revisions for its guidance in 1Q25, projecting revenue to reach $12.2 billion, which reflects a 14.4% quarter-over-quarter decline and a 4.1% year-over-year reduction, both falling short of internal and market expectations. Furthermore, Intel's gross margin (GM) is anticipated to drop to 36% in 1Q25, substantially lower than projected benchmarks, indicating persistent profitability challenges amidst stagnant revenue contributions from its foundry business."],"bullsSay":["Intel's recent quarterly revenue reached $4.5 billion, marking a 3.4% sequential increase, attributed to a higher mix of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wafers and improved equipment sales driven by returning demand in the data center and edge business. The expansion into the foundry segment, along with the growing EUV wafer mix, is expected to enhance gross margins, which positions Intel for improved profitability moving forward. Additionally, favorable macroeconomic conditions and the potential upside from data-centric businesses and PC sales position the company for continued growth and market leadership in the semiconductor

for Sun Life Financial's stock is negatively impacted by substantial challenges in achieving its 8-10% underlying EPS growth target, primarily due to significant outflows in its investment management

Additionally, the company faces difficulties in its Asia segment, particularly in sub-scale markets like China and Indonesia, where return on equity (ROE) is around 2%, contrasting sharply with nearly 20% ROE in more established markets. Compounding these issues are regulatory pressures, credit impairments, low long-term interest rates, and potential volatility in equity markets, all of which contribute to a challenging operating environment."],"bullsSay":["Sun Life Financial demonstrates a strong financial outlook, driven by robust growth in its capital-light businesses, which accounted for 74% of the company’s underlying net income in 2023.

Additionally, the company carries significant total unsecured debt of $117.9 billion, with a leverage ratio of 2.3 times, which heightens financial risk amid increasing competition and potential regulatory changes.

The company's return on capital improved significantly from 6.06% to 7.61% over the last twelve months, indicating enhanced operational efficiency and profitability.

Pizza reported Q4 domestic same-store sales (SSS) growth of 0.4%, falling short of the consensus estimate of 1.4%, which raises concerns about the company's ability to drive sales momentum in a competitive market. The anticipated negative impact from franchisee profitability issues and 200 store closures in 2025 further complicates growth expectations, leading to downward revisions in future SSS growth estimates. Additionally, external risks such as economic downturns, low consumer confidence, and unfavorable foreign exchange trends may pose significant headwinds to the company's earnings and operational stability moving forward."],"bullsSay":["Domino's Pizza, the largest player in the global pizza market with nearly 21,400 stores and approximately $19.2 billion in system sales for 2024, is experiencing strong carryout same-store sales (SSS) growth, driven by a revamped loyalty program and an increasing carryout sales mix. The company is positioned to maintain its momentum in FY25, with guidance for global retail sales growth expected to match the 5.9% achieved in FY24 and operating income projected to grow by 8%, despite a possible foreign exchange impact. Furthermore, Domino's plan to expand its delivery options through platforms like DoorDash and continued product innovation, including new menu items, signals potential for sustained traffic growth in

financial outlook is negatively impacted by a significant decline in mobile game revenue, which fell 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to a lack of both strong existing titles and new game

Compounding these issues, the gross profit margin decreased to 60.8% due to increased reliance on licensed games with lower margins, leading to lowered revenue projections for both fourth quarter and full-year growth."],"bullsSay":["NetEase's games revenue experienced a 2% year-over-year growth in Q4, primarily driven by a remarkable 59% increase in PC games, facilitated by the return of popular Blizzard titles and the success of established games alongside new releases.

Inc. is facing a negative outlook due to an anticipated 2.0% decline in normalized funds from operations (FFO) in 2024, with only a slight recovery projected in 2025, primarily influenced by expected occupancy declines in the first half of 2025. Additionally, the company has lowered its 2025 and 2026 earnings estimates, reflecting heightened risks associated with a potential recession impacting office employment and persistent high interest rates that may further deter demand in key markets. Furthermore, rising construction costs have increased tenant improvement expenses, compounding the challenges faced by BXP's portfolio of primarily office buildings in a post-COVID-19 environment."],"bullsSay":["BXP Inc. is experiencing strong fundamentals, as evidenced by an increase in the 2024 FFO estimate to $7.10 per share, reflecting robust performance in 3Q24. The company has demonstrated significant leasing success, with 4Q24 leasing being the fifth highest ever and double-digit positive GAAP rent spreads projected for both FY25 and beyond.

analysis indicates a negative outlook on McDonald's stock, largely due to a fourth-quarter EPS of $2.83 falling slightly short of the consensus estimate, driven by lower company margins and increased operating expenses. The firm's guidance points to a decreased 2025 EPS estimate of $12.39, reflecting challenges such as food safety recovery efforts that contracted store-level margins by 170 basis points and a decline in same-store sales of 1.4%. Additionally, key risks remain prevalent, including deteriorating economic conditions, slower growth in EBITDA and free cash flow, and a reduced operating margin estimate for 2025, which underscores concerns over the company's performance trajectory and competitive positioning in the industry."],"bullsSay":["McDonald's, as the largest restaurant owner-operator globally, generated system sales of $131 billion in 2024 from over 43,000 stores across 115 markets, with approximately 60% of its revenue derived from franchise royalty fees and lease payments. The company's strategic initiatives, including enhancing value platforms and product innovation, are expected to bolster same-store sales (SSS) growth, with notable increases projected in both the International Operated Markets (IOM) and International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDLM) segments.

Campbell Company is experiencing a challenging financial landscape, illustrated by a flat gross profit margin for the year due to increased promotional investments, which heightens earnings risk amidst a sluggish consumer recovery. The company's first quarter of fiscal 2025 showed a decline in organic sales by 1%, and leadership brands within the snacks segment faced a 2% drop in growth, exacerbated by competitive pressures and trade-down behaviors to private label products. Furthermore, Campbell has lowered its fiscal year 2025 guidance, indicating a slower-than-anticipated recovery in its snacking categories and a long-term struggle to meet sales growth targets, reflecting a persistently weak volume performance and a negative outlook compared to industry averages."],"bullsSay":["The Campbell Soup Company has demonstrated strong performance, with its soup portfolio achieving volume share growth for five consecutive quarters, benefiting from increased at-home cooking trends. The recent acquisition of Rao’s and growth in the broth category further support the company's leadership in the Meals \u0026 Beverages segment, with a 4% increase in consumption among its key brands.

Processing (ADP) is facing challenges reflected in its FY25 new business bookings guidance of only 4-7%, significantly lower than the 7% growth previously experienced in FY24, influenced by a decline in client revenue retention attributed to higher small business closures and slower economic growth. Additionally, the company anticipates a reduction in client retention by 30-10 basis points year-over-year, alongside a projected decline in Professional Employer Organization (PEO) margins, raising concerns about continued profitability under current market conditions. Furthermore, the overall economic environment, marked by broad-based hiring slowdowns and layoffs, poses significant risks to ADP's future growth, leading to expectations of potential downside revisions in earnings per share estimates."],"bullsSay":["ADP has demonstrated strong performance in its employer services segment, with new business bookings growth of approximately 7% in the fourth quarter of FY24, aligning with its strategic guidance. Revenue growth of about 6.5% year-over-year was driven by robust performance in the professional employer organization (PEO) sector and interest on client-held funds, reinforcing ADP's competitive position in payroll and human capital management solutions.
