For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

has experienced significant pressure on its stock due to historical patterns, with its next twelve months price-to-earnings (NTM P/E) ratio contracting nearly 40% during the 2008-09 recession, suggesting vulnerability to economic downturns. Current operational challenges, including decelerating food volumes in China, shifts in Mexico tied to election-related socioeconomic factors, and adverse weather impacting parts of western Europe, have prompted a reduction in the company's organic growth estimates for fiscal year 2024 from 3.2% to 1.9%. Additionally, the company's overall underperformance relative to market expectations has fostered a negative sentiment regarding its financial outlook for 2025, with anticipated guidance remaining cautious."],"bullsSay":["PepsiCo's strong positioning in the global snacks and beverages market is underscored by its ownership of leading brands and its dominance in savory snacks, which drive approximately 55% of its total revenue.

is anticipated to experience a significant year-over-year decline in earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter, projected to be more substantial than the 24% decline observed in the first quarter, due to peak restructuring charges and ongoing investments that are expected to suppress margins for an extended period. Although there were slight improvements in same-store sales, the company faces challenges in the channel development segment, where higher input costs are likely to reduce demand, leading to revised lower revenue estimates. The combination of increased labor costs, ineffective traffic-driving strategies from the new CEO, and a notable decrease in discounted transactions further contributes to a negative financial outlook for the company."],"bullsSay":["Starbucks is experiencing a positive turnaround, highlighted by a 2.4% quarter-over-quarter increase in lapsed rewards members, totaling 34.6 million, which is expected to drive revenue growth. Additionally, the company has updated its revenue estimates for 2026, indicating higher expectations for company-operated revenue that outweigh declines in licensed and channel development segments. Improvements in international same-store sales, particularly in China, along with enhanced visitation trends and a focus on customer experience, suggest the potential for stronger sales leverage and profitability in the near term."],"charts":[{"title":"Store

analysis indicates a negative outlook on McDonald's stock, largely due to a fourth-quarter EPS of $2.83 falling slightly short of the consensus estimate, driven by lower company margins and increased operating expenses. The firm's guidance points to a decreased 2025 EPS estimate of $12.39, reflecting challenges such as food safety recovery efforts that contracted store-level margins by 170 basis points and a decline in same-store sales of 1.4%. Additionally, key risks remain prevalent, including deteriorating economic conditions, slower growth in EBITDA and free cash flow, and a reduced operating margin estimate for 2025, which underscores concerns over the company's performance trajectory and competitive positioning in the industry."],"bullsSay":["McDonald's, as the largest restaurant owner-operator globally, generated system sales of $131 billion in 2024 from over 43,000 stores across 115 markets, with approximately 60% of its revenue derived from franchise royalty fees and lease payments. The company's strategic initiatives, including enhancing value platforms and product innovation, are expected to bolster same-store sales (SSS) growth, with notable increases projected in both the International Operated Markets (IOM) and International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDLM) segments.

The reported Q3 adjusted EBITDA also missed forecasts, compounded by a lower relative unit growth rate and underperformance in unit-level margins, suggesting ongoing struggles with maintaining competitive unit economics."],"bullsSay":["BJ's Restaurants Inc. has shown an impressive increase in same-store sales (SSS) growth estimates for Q4, rising from 1.0% to 4.0%, driven by a transaction growth forecast of 3.0%, indicating effective promotional strategies. Furthermore, the company has adjusted its 2025 earnings per share (EPS) estimate to $1.74, reflecting improved financial performance expectations. The combination of a solid start to Q4 and favorable year-over-year comparisons positions BJ's Restaurants for potential market share gains and enhanced profitability."],"charts":[],"chartsLastUpdated":null,"etfHoldings":null,"etfHoldingsLastUpdated":null},"advancedCryptoData":null,"buySellRatio":null,"advancedInfoAvailable":true,"advancedInfoDummy":false},{"instrument":{"symbol":"RRGB","name":"Red Robin","displayName":"Red Robin","availableForFractional":false,"availableForTrade":true,"safetyLabel":"LOW_MARKET_CAP","trading":"BUY_AND_SELL","optionsTrading":"BUY_AND_SELL","optionsSpreadTrading":"DISABLED","tradingFractional":"SELL_ALL_ONLY","instrumentClass":"STOCK","daysToIpo":null,"ipoDate":null,"untradableReason":null,"newSymbol":null,"newSymbolDate":null,"nameAlternatives":[],"rootSymbol":null,"rootSymbolName":null,"marginRequirement":null},"quote":{"symbol":"RRGB","lastUpdated":"2025-07-24T20:00:00Z","batsLastUpdated":"2025-07-24T20:00:00Z","previousClose":7.44,"high":7.4,"low":6.7701,"volume":445967,"volumeDate":"2025-07-24","last":6.97,"open":7.36,"gainPercentage":-6.317,"gainValue":-0.47,"ask":7.9,"bid":6.7,"tradingHalted":false},"instrumentCompanyDetails":{"fundamental":{"marketCapitalization":123619200,"instrumentClass":"STOCK","averageDailyVolumeLast3Months":993006.6774,"highPriceLast52Weeks":7.8854,"lowPriceLast52Weeks":2.5,"companyName":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.","longBusinessDescription":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. develops, operates, and franchises full-service restaurants North America.

FY25 revenue for Amazon.com has been revised downward to $699.4 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of only 10%, which is 1% less than previous estimates. In addition, ongoing stagnation in product sales, which have been trapped between $61 billion and $67 billion outside of the traditionally strong fourth quarter since the beginning of 2021, raises concerns about the overall growth trajectory. Furthermore, the company's decision to decrease the useful life of certain servers, anticipated to reduce operating income by approximately $700 million, suggests potential operational inefficiencies that could further impact profitability amidst broader economic uncertainties."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com demonstrates a strong financial outlook driven by notable growth in key segments.

outlook for Wingstop appears negative due to a significant downward revision in earnings and revenue projections, with the forward year P/E multiple decreasing substantially from approximately 90x to below 50x. Mixed operating results for the fourth quarter of 2024 showed reported revenue, same-store sales, and revenue from operating multiple (RLOM) all falling short of consensus expectations, despite certain metrics beating estimates. Furthermore, a decline in consensus estimates for 2026 EBITDA and EPS, combined with risks from tighter credit conditions, potential delivery headwinds, and rising chicken wing prices, could adversely affect operational stability and store-level margins, suggesting a challenging environment for future growth."],"bullsSay":["Wingstop's robust growth trajectory is highlighted by its substantial expansion, reaching 2,689 global stores by the first quarter of 2025, and a strong emphasis on a franchised business model that accounts for 98% of its operations, generating significant revenue from franchise royalties and advertising fees. The company showcases promising potential for future sales acceleration, with increasing average unit volumes (AUV) expected to progress towards a $3 million long-term goal, supported by successful transactional lifts and enhanced food quality observed during management's testing phase. Additionally, Wingstop's competitive edge is underscored by impressive unit growth at 16% and strong restaurant-level margins at 23.5%, which, combined with its focus on a traffic-driven strategy, positions the company well for sustained success in the quick-service restaurant sector."],"charts":[],"chartsLastUpdated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","etfHoldings":null,"etfHoldingsLastUpdated":null},"advancedCryptoData":null,"buySellRatio":null,"advancedInfoAvailable":true,"advancedInfoDummy":false},{"instrument":{"symbol":"PBPB","name":"Potbelly","displayName":"Potbelly","availableForFractional":false,"availableForTrade":true,"safetyLabel":"LOW_MARKET_CAP","trading":"BUY_AND_SELL","optionsTrading":"BUY_AND_SELL","optionsSpreadTrading":"DISABLED","tradingFractional":"SELL_ALL_ONLY","instrumentClass":"STOCK","daysToIpo":null,"ipoDate":null,"untradableReason":null,"newSymbol":null,"newSymbolDate":null,"nameAlternatives":[],"rootSymbol":null,"rootSymbolName":null,"marginRequirement":null},"quote":{"symbol":"PBPB","lastUpdated":"2025-07-24T20:00:00Z","batsLastUpdated":"2025-07-24T20:00:00Z","previousClose":12.98,"high":13.09,"low":12.62,"volume":251615,"volumeDate":"2025-07-24","last":12.64,"open":12.97,"gainPercentage":-2.619,"gainValue":-0.34,"ask":15,"bid":8.2,"tradingHalted":false},"instrumentCompanyDetails":{"fundamental":{"marketCapitalization":381376600,"instrumentClass":"STOCK","averageDailyVolumeLast3Months":221601,"highPriceLast52Weeks":13.48,"lowPriceLast52Weeks":6.28,"companyName":"Potbelly Corp.","longBusinessDescription":"Potbelly Corp. engages in the owning and operating of sandwich restaurants.

faces significant challenges due to a general decline in consumer spending driven by recessionary pressures, which is compounded by rising utility and gasoline prices, interest rates, and increased unemployment, all adversely affecting traffic and sales. Additionally, the company has struggled with operational inefficiencies, including a deficient food experience and virtually no marketing spend, while strained relations with franchisees further complicate its business outlook. The potential for future government-mandated store closures and capacity restrictions related to public health concerns could severely impact both sales and profitability, undermining confidence in Potbelly's growth objectives."],"bullsSay":["Potbelly Corp has demonstrated significant operational improvements under the leadership of CEO Bob Wright, with average weekly sales increasing to approximately $25,000 in FY23, reflecting successful implementation of the Five Pillar plan and enhanced shop-level operating models. The company's financial metrics are also positive, with an adjusted EPS growth of 34% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 39%, indicating strong profitability trends and effective cost management strategies. Furthermore, the anticipated rise in shop-level margins to approximately 16% by the end of FY24, coupled with the sustained growth in digital transactions and an expanding loyalty program, underscores a solid outlook for continued revenue and operational growth."],"charts":[],"chartsLastUpdated":null,"etfHoldings":null,"etfHoldingsLastUpdated":null},"advancedCryptoData":null,"buySellRatio":null,"advancedInfoAvailable":true,"advancedInfoDummy":false},{"instrument":{"symbol":"GTIM","name":"Good Times Restaurants","displayName":"Good Times Restaurants","availableForFractional":false,"availableForTrade":true,"safetyLabel":"LOW_MARKET_CAP","trading":"BUY_AND_SELL","optionsTrading":"DISABLED","optionsSpreadTrading":"DISABLED","tradingFractional":"SELL_ALL_ONLY","instrumentClass":"STOCK","daysToIpo":null,"ipoDate":null,"untradableReason":null,"newSymbol":null,"newSymbolDate":null,"nameAlternatives":[],"rootSymbol":null,"rootSymbolName":null,"marginRequirement":null},"quote":{"symbol":"GTIM","lastUpdated":"2025-07-24T19:59:46Z","batsLastUpdated":"2025-07-24T19:59:46Z","previousClose":1.56,"high":1.56,"low":1.41,"volume":75076,"volumeDate":"2025-07-24","last":1.47,"open":1.53,"gainPercentage":-5.769,"gainValue":-0.09,"ask":1.61,"bid":1.43,"tradingHalted":false},"instrumentCompanyDetails":{"fundamental":{"marketCapitalization":15567900,"instrumentClass":"STOCK","averageDailyVolumeLast3Months":20737.3226,"highPriceLast52Weeks":3.45,"lowPriceLast52Weeks":1.41,"companyName":"Good Times Restaurants, Inc.","longBusinessDescription":"Good Times Restaurants, Inc. engages in the operation of two restaurant concepts.
