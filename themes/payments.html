For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

Financial's recent performance indicates a concerning trend, highlighted by a sequential decrease in retail auto origination yields by 5 basis points to 10.54%, which places additional pressure on

Furthermore, the firm's loan portfolio contracted to $136.0 billion, reflecting a sequential decline of 1.1% and a year-over-year decrease of 2.4%, signifying challenges in loan growth and consumer demand.

is confronting a negative outlook due to a downward revision of its FY25 merchant solutions revenue growth to 5.3%, falling below its peers and historical averages, which reflects concerns regarding

The company faces significant risks, including a potential macroeconomic slowdown, heightened competition, and its struggle to achieve a favorable mix shift, all of which could adversely impact stock performance and revenue recovery. Furthermore, Global Payments' valuation is set at approximately 11x its CY25 EPS estimate, indicating that, despite potential for multiple expansion, its guidance and expected time for revenue growth reacceleration remain challenging."],"bullsSay":["Global Payments has strategically expanded its market share through innovative partner models, resulting in significant growth opportunities in its Vertical Markets segment, which rose by 10% annually in FY'24. The company has experienced strong momentum in its integrated revenue, marked by double-digit growth in the second quarter of FY'24, alongside robust activity in point-of-sale (POS) solutions, which grew approximately 20% over recent quarters due to strong average revenue per user (ARPU) increases.

The company has high exposure to fuel prices, which could significantly impact its revenue if prices decline. There is also a risk of payment systems breach that could negatively affect the company's reputation and financials. Additionally, competition in its market is fierce, and macroeconomic conditions could also affect revenue growth. On the other hand, potential upside risks include accretive M\u0026A, sustained organic growth, and abating macro concerns.

Corporation faces a challenging financial outlook marked by a significant decline in ACV bookings, which fell by approximately 22% year-over-year in the first half of fiscal 2024, compounded by foreign exchange impacts and decreased customer usage. The company's earnings per share of $5.79 fell short of both internal estimates and market consensus due to weaker revenues and rising expenses, exacerbated by a shift to a subscription-based revenue model and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. Furthermore, the persistent high interest rates and subdued mortgage inquiry volumes signal continued pressure on the firm's software revenues and overall financial performance in the near term."],"bullsSay":["Fair Isaac Corporation demonstrates a positive outlook driven by a notable 16% year-over-year increase in Annual Contract Value (ACV) bookings in the first quarter of FY25, with expectations for Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth to accelerate to 30% by the end of the fiscal year. The company's mortgage origination revenue surged 110% year-over-year in Q1 FY25, indicating strong demand, as supported by forecasts of a 7% increase in mortgage originations for FY25 and a projected 12% increase for FY26. Additionally, with personal loan originations witnessing a 16% year-over-year rise, Fair Isaac is well-positioned to leverage its FICO Scores and software offerings, particularly as consumer credit demand grows in varying risk tiers."],"charts":[],"chartsLastUpdated":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","etfHoldings":null,"etfHoldingsLastUpdated":null},"advancedCryptoData":null,"buySellRatio":{"buy":0.49,"sell":0.51,"lastUpdated":"2025-07-24T00:00:00Z"},"advancedInfoAvailable":true,"advancedInfoDummy":false},{"instrument":{"symbol":"WEX","name":"WEX","displayName":"WEX","availableForFractional":true,"availableForTrade":true,"safetyLabel":null,"trading":"BUY_AND_SELL","optionsTrading":"BUY_AND_SELL","optionsSpreadTrading":"DISABLED","tradingFractional":"BUY_AND_SELL","instrumentClass":"STOCK","daysToIpo":null,"ipoDate":null,"untradableReason":null,"newSymbol":null,"newSymbolDate":null,"nameAlternatives":[],"rootSymbol":null,"rootSymbolName":null,"marginRequirement":null},"quote":{"symbol":"WEX","lastUpdated":"2025-07-24T20:00:00Z","batsLastUpdated":"2025-07-24T20:00:00Z","previousClose":163.4,"high":180.7067,"low":165.08,"volume":1421699,"volumeDate":"2025-07-24","last":174.1,"open":170.63,"gainPercentage":6.548,"gainValue":10.7,"ask":276.81,"bid":129.7,"tradingHalted":false},"instrumentCompanyDetails":{"fundamental":{"marketCapitalization":5961967400,"instrumentClass":"STOCK","averageDailyVolumeLast3Months":518812.1613,"highPriceLast52Weeks":217.47,"lowPriceLast52Weeks":110.45,"companyName":"WEX, Inc.","longBusinessDescription":"WEX, Inc. engages in the provision of payment processing and information management solutions.

noninterest income has seen a slight decline quarter-over-quarter, dropping to $8.68 billion, coupled with a reduced CET1 ratio of 11.1%, which indicates potential vulnerability given the higher rates affecting market instruments. Despite a modest decrease in nonperforming assets, net interest income fell to $11.7 billion, reflecting ongoing pressure on profitability compared to both the previous quarter and the same quarter last year. The bank faces several significant risks, including projected declines in asset quality and potential macroeconomic challenges that could further hinder earnings and loan growth."],"bullsSay":["Wells Fargo has reported a substantial year-over-year increase in investment banking fees, rising nearly 60% to $725 million, reflecting its strategic investments in this area. The bank's net interest income (NII) of $11.9 billion surpassed estimates, with a net interest margin (NIM) of 2.70%, showing robust growth driven by better-than-expected net interest-bearing deposit growth. Additionally, the book value per share has risen significantly, increasing 4.8% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, indicating solid underlying asset strength and improved profitability metrics, including a sequential rise in core return on equity."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Interest income","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":9834},{"key":"21 Q4","value":10121},{"key":"22 Q1","value":10181},{"key":"22 Q2","value":11556},{"key":"22 Q3","value":14494},{"key":"22 Q4","value":17793},{"key":"23 Q1","value":19356},{"key":"23 Q2","value":20830},{"key":"23 Q3","value":22093},{"key":"23 Q4","value":22839},{"key":"24 Q1","value":22840},{"key":"24 Q2","value":22884},{"key":"24 Q3","value":22998},{"key":"24 Q4","value":22055},{"key":"25 Q1","value":20973},{"key":"25 Q2","value":21320}]},{"title":"Noninterest income","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":9925},{"key":"21 Q4","value":11594},{"key":"22 Q1","value":8371},{"key":"22 Q2","value":6830},{"key":"22 Q3","value":7407},{"key":"22 Q4","value":6227},{"key":"23 Q1","value":7393},{"key":"23 Q2","value":7370},{"key":"23 Q3","value":7752},{"key":"23 Q4","value":7707},{"key":"24 Q1","value":8636},{"key":"24 Q2","value":8766},{"key":"24 Q3","value":8676},{"key":"24 Q4","value":8542},{"key":"25 Q1","value":8654},{"key":"25 Q2","value":9114}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":35.05},{"key":"21 Q4","value":37.34},{"key":"22 Q1","value":24.3},{"key":"22 Q2","value":19.38},{"key":"22 Q3","value":20.06},{"key":"22 Q4","value":10.41},{"key":"23 Q1","value":21.85},{"key":"23 Q2","value":20.68},{"key":"23 Q3","value":21.93},{"key":"23 Q4","value":11.16},{"key":"24 Q1","value":17.75},{"key":"24 Q2","value":19.46},{"key":"24 Q3","value":19.68},{"key":"24 Q4","value":17.59},{"key":"25 Q1","value":17.97},{"key":"25 Q2","value":21.15}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":25.92},{"key":"21 Q4","value":26.47},{"key":"22 Q1","value":19.78},{"key":"22 Q2","value":16.96},{"key":"22 Q3","value":16.1},{"key":"22 Q4","value":11.92},{"key":"23 Q1","value":18.65},{"key":"23 Q2","value":17.51},{"key":"23 Q3","value":19.32},{"key":"23 Q4","value":11.28},{"key":"24 Q1","value":14.67},{"key":"24 Q2","value":15.51},{"key":"24 Q3","value":16.14},{"key":"24 Q4","value":16.59},{"key":"25 Q1","value":16.51},{"key":"25 Q2","value":18.05}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

faces a negative outlook due to several fundamental challenges, including a first quarter gross profit projection of $2.32 billion, which falls below the consensus expectation of $2.39 billion. Additionally, growth trends for the Cash App service have been disappointing, as monthly active users remained flat year-over-year with lighter engagement metrics. Furthermore, the fiscal year 2025 gross profit expectation of at least $10.22 billion is also below consensus estimates, indicating potential difficulty in achieving growth targets amidst increasing macro uncertainties and competitive threats."],"bullsSay":["Block's stock benefits from continued positive trends in seller revenue and stronger gross payment volume (GPV) in the United States, with GPV rising approximately 7% attributed to improved customer retention and same store growth.

faces a negative outlook due to a combination of macroeconomic challenges and significant competition that could hinder its growth trajectory until late FY25. The company's profitability might be adversely affected by potential increases in interchange fees imposed by payment card networks, alongside regulatory risks that could impact operations. Moreover, the need to renegotiate contracts with Braintree merchants further complicates growth prospects, contributing to an uncertain financial future for PayPal."],"bullsSay":["PayPal Holdings is anticipated to experience robust growth, with non-GAAP EPS expected to rise in the low-teens for FY27 and exceed 20% in the long-term, underscoring a positive trajectory in earnings. The integration of its omnichannel approach, alongside the growth of Venmo and innovations like Fastlane, positions PayPal to benefit from a sustainable increase in total payment volume (TPV) and transaction margins, aiming for high single-digit growth by FY27. Additionally, substantial gains in PayPal's debit card offerings, with TPV increasing by 100% year-over-year in 4Q24, reflect the company's commitment to expanding its product ecosystem and enhancing consumer awareness."],"charts":[{"title":"Active
