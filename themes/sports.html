For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

analysis indicates a negative outlook for Alphabet's stock primarily due to several financial headwinds, including flat capital expenditures of $13 billion expected to persist into the fourth quarter alongside anticipated substantial growth in 2025 that is projected to be less than the 60% growth experienced in 2024. There are anticipated challenges in fourth quarter advertising revenue, particularly stemming from tough comparisons with Asian retailers and a slowdown in consumer spending that could reduce advertising budgets. Additionally, increasing costs related to new projects, potential privacy regulations, and intensified competition are likely to adversely impact Alphabet’s financial performance and overall market position."],"bullsSay":["Alphabet's stock outlook is bolstered by strong performance across various segments, particularly with a 35% year-over-year revenue increase from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and positive shifts in operating income predictions for 2024 and 2025. Enhanced engagement driven by AI innovations is significantly improving consumer intent understanding, leading to better advertiser return on investment amidst increased activity in key sectors such as financial services and retail. Additionally, a noted improvement in monetization efforts on YouTube and a robust trajectory in core search operations contribute to the overall optimism regarding the company’s financial

outlook for Amazon.com is clouded by multiple concerning factors, including a lowered fiscal year 2025 revenue estimate of $699.4 billion, representing only a 10% year-over-year growth, and a corresponding reduction in earnings per share (EPS) to $6.10. Despite the historically strong performance of the fourth quarter, product sales have stagnated between $61 billion and $67 billion in the three preceding quarters since the first quarter of 2021, raising concerns about sustained growth. Additionally, adjustments such as the lowering of server useful life, expected to decrease operating income by approximately $700 million, alongside foreign exchange impacts and a potential economic slowdown, suggest that Amazon's stock may face vulnerabilities in its trading multiples."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com displays a robust financial outlook, driven by a significant 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), achieving $28.8 billion in 4Q24, alongside a notable 48% increase in operating income, which indicates a strong operating margin of 37%. The company's retail and service revenues are experiencing positive momentum, with service revenues accounting for 56% of total sales and showing potential for valuation multiple expansion, while advertising revenue has surged to an annualized run rate of $69 billion, reflecting an 18% increase year-over-year. Additionally, the continued growth in Prime membership and enhancements in operational efficiency, alongside management's expectations for easing AWS capacity constraints in the near future, contribute to an encouraging financial landscape for Amazon."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the

has revised its fiscal year 2025 guidance downward, projecting revenue between $7.00 billion and $7.15 billion, a decrease from a prior estimate of $7.50 billion to $7.80 billion, along with a significant cut in earnings per share estimates from $7.35–$7.95 to $6.25–$6.65. The firm is experiencing notable underperformance in its Live Services segment, with bookings now expected to decline 4%-6%, in stark contrast to earlier projections of growth of 1%-5%, primarily due to disappointing sales of titles such as EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

Additionally, the Intel Foundry business is experiencing growth, with an improved gross margin anticipated as the product mix shifts toward more profitable EUV wafers, aided by customers proactively hedging against potential tariffs.

Furthermore, the company faces various risks that could further dampen its financial outlook, including slow AI adoption, weakened demand in gaming markets, rising competition, and challenges in product execution, all of which could adversely impact revenue growth."],"bullsSay":["Nvidia's financial outlook is bolstered by a significant increase in compute revenue, which reached $32.556 billion, reflecting an 18% quarter-over-quarter growth and a remarkable 116% year-over-year growth, driven by expanding demand in data centers and AI applications. The company's robust balance sheet includes cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities amounting to $43.2 billion, a substantial increase from $26.0 billion a year ago, indicating strong liquidity and financial health.

Furthermore, projections for flattish AI GPU revenue in the first half of 2025, estimated at approximately $1.75-$1.80 billion per quarter, coupled with concerns regarding execution on new product launches, suggest potential revenue stagnation and underscore a negative outlook for the company’s financial trajectory."],"bullsSay":["Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) anticipates a strengthened demand environment across its business segments in 2025, forecasting robust growth particularly in the Data Center and Client segments, with notable quarterly sales increases of 12% in Q4 driven by substantial gains in its Client, Data Center, and Gaming segments.

International is projected to experience a decline in revenue, with an expected drop of 14% to 19% year-over-year in the first half of FY:24, as segments that benefited during the pandemic, such as

The company's consensus estimates indicate persistent declines in key product lines, including an 11% drop in Keyboards and Combos and a 30% decline in Video Collaboration. Furthermore, a modeling of profit margins reveals a projected gross margin of 38% for Q3, reflecting a substantial decrease of 350 basis points quarter-over-quarter, which underscores ongoing operational challenges."],"bullsSay":["Logitech International is demonstrating improved financial performance, highlighted by a gross margin of 39%, which reflects an increase of 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 80 basis points year-over-year, attributed to a strengthened inventory position ahead of the holiday season. Furthermore, the company is poised for stronger operating income for FY:24, expected to exceed previous guidance levels, which indicates resilience despite challenges in the Video Conferencing segment.

faces a challenging outlook due to the potential for multiple compression if investor sentiment declines or if IT spending significantly falters, particularly under the weight of current macroeconomic pressures. Currency fluctuations are expected to apply further strain, reducing IBM's projected revenue growth rate by approximately 2% for 2025, compounded by the scrutiny surrounding IT expenditures amid high global interest rates. Additionally, competition from new entrants, customer attrition, and the company's struggles to innovate and meet evolving market demands could hinder growth and further impact revenue projections."],"bullsSay":["IBM is poised for strong growth in its software portfolio, expected to expand at 10% or higher in constant currency, contributing to a projected revenue increase of 5.2% CAGR from 2024 to 2027.
