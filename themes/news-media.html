For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

Communications has reported a decline in Economic Operating Cash Flow (EBITDAR) of 3.77% year-over-year, dropping from $51.16 billion to $49.23 billion, reflecting pressures on its revenue outlook primarily due to the integration challenges of TracFone and a weakened consumer postpaid offering. Additionally, the company carries significant total unsecured debt of $117.9 billion, with a leverage ratio of 2.3 times, which heightens financial risk amid increasing competition and potential regulatory changes. The firm also faces operational uncertainties, including the risk of unforeseen events that could adversely affect its business performance, potentially hindering its ability to meet investment objectives."],"bullsSay":["Verizon Communications demonstrated a modest increase in net sales revenue of 0.61% year-over-year, rising from $133.97 billion to $134.79 billion for the 12 months ending December 2024, alongside a 2.2% increase in consumer revenue for the fourth quarter driven by service revenue growth. The company's return on capital improved significantly from 6.06% to 7.61% over the last twelve months, indicating enhanced operational efficiency and profitability.

reported a disappointing performance, missing financial expectations across multiple metrics, which has led to a downward revision of EPS estimates by 6% for 2023 and 2024, reflecting a prolonged recovery in investment realizations and deployment activity. The company faces significant downside risks, including a potential protracted pullback in financial and capital markets that could impair investment harvesting, reduce realized performance fees, and negatively impact cash earnings. Additionally, a challenging exit and investing environment has resulted in lower returns than historical averages, weaker fundraising, and a projected decline in organic net flows by 10%, all contributing to a negative outlook for Blackstone's stock."],"bullsSay":["Blackstone has demonstrated robust demand for its private credit solutions, accounting for approximately 50% of its inflows in the third quarter of 2023, which positions the firm favorably given the recent pullback in traditional lending. With a strong investment track record and consistent growth in both fundraising and deployment, the company is well-placed to benefit from potential increases in private wealth fundraising and global economic growth.

experienced an 11% decline in stock value, primarily attributed to disappointing broadband unit growth, leading to an adjustment in fiscal year 2025 earnings per share (EPS) expectations from $4.37 to $4.21, with a projected flat growth in adjusted EBITDA of $38 billion. Additionally, the forecast now anticipates a net loss of 506,000 broadband subscribers by 2025, worsening from an earlier projection of a loss of 322,000, which further decreases the EPS estimate for fiscal year 2026 from $4.95 to $4.74. Margins are likely to be pressured due to investments in theme parks and marketing costs, combined with potential revenue declines stemming from a shift in pricing strategy, leading to concerns about average revenue per user growth and resulting in a reevaluation of Comcast's fair valuation."],"bullsSay":["Comcast demonstrated strong financial performance with a 10% increase in total adjusted EBITDA, reaching $8.8 billion, highlighting robust revenue generation capabilities. The company's wireless segment achieved 307,000 net additions, marking a 12% penetration of its customer base, which contributes positively to its overall growth strategy.

outlook for Amazon.com is clouded by multiple concerning factors, including a lowered fiscal year 2025 revenue estimate of $699.4 billion, representing only a 10% year-over-year growth, and a corresponding reduction in earnings per share (EPS) to $6.10. Despite the historically strong performance of the fourth quarter, product sales have stagnated between $61 billion and $67 billion in the three preceding quarters since the first quarter of 2021, raising concerns about sustained growth. Additionally, adjustments such as the lowering of server useful life, expected to decrease operating income by approximately $700 million, alongside foreign exchange impacts and a potential economic slowdown, suggest that Amazon's stock may face vulnerabilities in its trading multiples."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com displays a robust financial outlook, driven by a significant 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), achieving $28.8 billion in 4Q24, alongside a notable 48% increase in operating income, which indicates a strong operating margin of 37%. The company's retail and service revenues are experiencing positive momentum, with service revenues accounting for 56% of total sales and showing potential for valuation multiple expansion, while advertising revenue has surged to an annualized run rate of $69 billion, reflecting an 18% increase year-over-year. Additionally, the continued growth in Prime membership and enhancements in operational efficiency, alongside management's expectations for easing AWS capacity constraints in the near future, contribute to an encouraging financial landscape for Amazon."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the
