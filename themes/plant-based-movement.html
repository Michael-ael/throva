For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

Campbell Company is experiencing a challenging financial landscape, illustrated by a flat gross profit margin for the year due to increased promotional investments, which heightens earnings risk amidst a sluggish consumer recovery. The company's first quarter of fiscal 2025 showed a decline in organic sales by 1%, and leadership brands within the snacks segment faced a 2% drop in growth, exacerbated by competitive pressures and trade-down behaviors to private label products. Furthermore, Campbell has lowered its fiscal year 2025 guidance, indicating a slower-than-anticipated recovery in its snacking categories and a long-term struggle to meet sales growth targets, reflecting a persistently weak volume performance and a negative outlook compared to industry averages."],"bullsSay":["The Campbell Soup Company has demonstrated strong performance, with its soup portfolio achieving volume share growth for five consecutive quarters, benefiting from increased at-home cooking trends. The recent acquisition of Rao’s and growth in the broth category further support the company's leadership in the Meals \u0026 Beverages segment, with a 4% increase in consumption among its key brands.

Brands has revised its operating margin outlook down to 14.8%, the lowest projected for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to higher-than-expected inflation, which has been increased to 4%, and a $0.04

In addition, the company has reported a significant decline in Swiss Miss volumes by 18% year-over-year, attributed to rising cocoa prices and delayed winter weather, which are expected to negatively impact gross margins in fiscal year 2025 by 90 basis points compared to the previous year. Overall, organic sales declined by 3.5%, and the company has lowered its FY'25 organic sales outlook to -0.1%, further influenced by an 11.1% drop in foodservice volumes from weakness in quick-service restaurant dining and the exit from lower-margin businesses."],"bullsSay":["Conagra Brands has demonstrated notable improvements in operating margins, with international operating margins increasing by 170 basis points due to strategic divestitures and grocery and snacks margins rising by 60 basis points, aided by insurance proceeds from a past recall.

outlook for Amazon.com is clouded by multiple concerning factors, including a lowered fiscal year 2025 revenue estimate of $699.4 billion, representing only a 10% year-over-year growth, and a corresponding reduction in earnings per share (EPS) to $6.10. Despite the historically strong performance of the fourth quarter, product sales have stagnated between $61 billion and $67 billion in the three preceding quarters since the first quarter of 2021, raising concerns about sustained growth. Additionally, adjustments such as the lowering of server useful life, expected to decrease operating income by approximately $700 million, alongside foreign exchange impacts and a potential economic slowdown, suggest that Amazon's stock may face vulnerabilities in its trading multiples."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com displays a robust financial outlook, driven by a significant 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), achieving $28.8 billion in 4Q24, alongside a notable 48% increase in operating income, which indicates a strong operating margin of 37%. The company's retail and service revenues are experiencing positive momentum, with service revenues accounting for 56% of total sales and showing potential for valuation multiple expansion, while advertising revenue has surged to an annualized run rate of $69 billion, reflecting an 18% increase year-over-year. Additionally, the continued growth in Prime membership and enhancements in operational efficiency, alongside management's expectations for easing AWS capacity constraints in the near future,

has lowered its fiscal year 2024 organic sales growth estimate to 7.5%, down from 9.2%, alongside a significant adjustment in its adjusted EBITDA projection to -$51.5 million, reflecting operational challenges and underperformance in the Americas segment, particularly due to share losses in key accounts like Starbucks. The company has expressed concerns regarding a potential slowdown in demand for oat-based products, which, coupled with delays in achieving profitability, raises red flags about its operational effectiveness and market positioning. Additionally, while capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to decline to below $75 million, this might not sufficiently address underlying liquidity issues or offset the decline in brand visibility and market share."],"bullsSay":["Oatly Group AB has demonstrated significant financial improvement, with gross margin surpassing consensus expectations by 190 basis points and expanding approximately 1,000 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to supply chain efficiencies and a favorable product mix. The company's projections for 2024 indicate an organic net sales growth revision to a range of 6–10%, reflecting confidence from positive volume trends across its segments and effective marketing investments. Additionally, as Oatly increases its owned and hybrid production capabilities, the potential for enhanced profitability and a pathway to achieving positive net profit becomes increasingly viable."],"charts":[{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":26.23},{"key":"21 Q4","value":15.91},{"key":"22 Q1","value":9.53},{"key":"22 Q2","value":15.81},{"key":"22 Q3","value":2.72},{"key":"22 Q4","value":15.91},{"key":"23 Q1","value":17.42},{"key":"23 Q2","value":19.21},{"key":"23 Q3","value":17.35},{"key":"23 Q4","value":23.4},{"key":"24 Q1","value":27.06},{"key":"24 Q2","value":29.15},{"key":"24 Q3","value":29.81},{"key":"24 Q4","value":28.75},{"key":"25 Q1","value":31.55},{"key":"25 Q2","value":32.45}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":-25.99},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-49.85},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-55.46},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-41.83},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-57.03},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-64.1},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-36.59},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-38.52},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-35.91},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-118.86},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-14.27},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-19.33},{"key":"24 Q3","value":-13.93},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-41.86},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-9.42},{"key":"25 Q2","value":-10.62}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":-24.09},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-42.9},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-52.63},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-40.46},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-58.99},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-64.17},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-38.63},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-44.25},{"key":"23 Q3","value":23.46},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-146.38},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-23.02},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-15.06},{"key":"24 Q3","value":-16.65},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-42.63},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-6.35},{"key":"25 Q2","value":-26.86}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

The company's EPS guidance for the second half of the fiscal year has been reduced, now expected at $3.73, reflecting softer gross margin expansion and the anticipated 3% adverse impact from foreign exchange on operating profit. Additionally, Kellanova is experiencing volume declines in key markets, such as an 11.7% drop in the AMEA segment, coupled with concerns about the sustainability of growth amid changing consumer behaviors and competitive pressures in the packaged food sector."],"bullsSay":["Kellanova has experienced robust organic revenue growth of 4.0% and notable improvements in both gross margin and operating margin, up by 340 basis points and 250 basis points, respectively, showcasing its strong financial performance in the packaged food sector.

Brands International has lowered its 2025 estimated net restaurant growth to 3.7%, indicating a decline from both previous estimates and consensus expectations, primarily due to unresolved issues in its China operations which have also resulted in bad debt expenses. The company faces substantial risks including potential share loss to competitors, particularly McDonald's, as well as ongoing pressures from an economic downturn, currency fluctuations, and rising operating costs. Additionally, operational challenges linked to rapid unit growth, coupled with potential stagnation in same-store sales for Tim Hortons, highlight the vulnerabilities that may hinder long-term profitability and growth."],"bullsSay":["Restaurant Brands International (RBI) reported solid performance metrics for its brands, with Tim Hortons experiencing a 2.2% increase in comparable sales and a 15th consecutive quarter of growing traffic in Canada despite challenging market conditions.
