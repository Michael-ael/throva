For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

anticipates declines in key financial metrics, as core aerospace margins are projected to decrease by approximately 100 basis points, with organic sales in the Industrial Automation segment expected to fall in the -Low Single Digits percentage range year-over-year in 2025. The company's adjusted sales guidance for Q4 2024 reflects a reduction of $400 million, translating to a shift from previous growth expectations of 2% to 4% to a projected range of -2% to flat growth, indicating potential ongoing challenges in the aerospace sector. Additionally, segment margins have contracted by 350 basis points year-over-year to 20.9%, signaling possible pressure on earnings per share with estimates suggesting a downside to approximately $9.60 for 2025 if growth remains lackluster and margins do not improve."],"bullsSay":["Honeywell has demonstrated consistent margin improvement over the past decade, with margins recently achieving new highs, which reflects the company's financial strength and operational efficiency. The firm's focus on organic sales growth has been evident, as it reported a 2% year-over-year increase, significantly outperforming consensus estimates, while segment margins are projected to rise by 60-100 basis points in 2025 despite some cost inflation. Additionally, Honeywell's strategic alignment with secular growth trends, particularly in the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment, positions it well for sustained revenue growth, bolstered by a strong demand pipeline in energy projects."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the

growth expectations have been significantly dampened due to broader economic pressures, resulting in a projected low-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth for FY25, which reflects weakened consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, a disappointing iPhone 16 cycle has been exacerbated by intense competition and a deceleration in services growth, leading to lowered shipment projections for the iPhone in FY25 and FY26. Lastly, heightened negative sentiment surrounding Apple has been fueled by delays in advanced features like Siri, concerns over China tariffs, and an overall jittery tech stock environment, suggesting a challenging outlook for the company."],"bullsSay":["Apple exhibits a strong financial outlook driven by robust iPhone sales, with projections indicating the company will sell approximately 225 million to 230 million units in FY25, followed by growth towards 245 million to 250 million units in FY26. The firm anticipates a significant uptick in revenue from iPhones, surpassing 20% year-over-year growth, spurred by strong consumer demand and an upgrade cycle with the iPhone 16.

Grumman's stock faces a negative outlook primarily due to a significant expected decline in revenue from its Space Systems segment, driven by the wind-down of key programs. Furthermore, the company's net estimate at completion (EAC) adjustments, which were previously a robust contributor to operating income, have substantially decreased, indicating issues with profitability. Lastly, concerns over potential defense budget cuts and market pressures related to ongoing inflation and contract challenges create substantial downside risks for future earnings and investor sentiment."],"bullsSay":["Northrop Grumman Corp has demonstrated a robust financial performance, evidenced by a 219% year-over-year increase in net EACs to $268 million as of 3Q24, reflecting continued strength in its Space Systems segment, which achieved a notable operating margin of 12%. The forecast for the combined B-21 Raider and Sentinel revenues indicates a promising 13% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2029, suggesting that revenue from these programs will significantly contribute to total revenues, increasing from approximately 13% in 2024 to 20% in 2029.

analysis indicates a negative outlook for Alphabet's stock primarily due to several financial headwinds, including flat capital expenditures of $13 billion expected to persist into the fourth quarter alongside anticipated substantial growth in 2025 that is projected to be less than the 60% growth experienced in 2024. There are anticipated challenges in fourth quarter advertising revenue, particularly stemming from tough comparisons with Asian retailers and a slowdown in consumer spending that could reduce advertising budgets. Additionally, increasing costs related to new projects, potential privacy regulations, and intensified competition are likely to adversely impact Alphabet’s financial performance and overall market position."],"bullsSay":["Alphabet's stock outlook is bolstered by strong performance across various segments, particularly with a 35% year-over-year revenue increase from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and positive shifts in operating income predictions for 2024 and 2025. Enhanced engagement driven by AI innovations is significantly improving consumer intent understanding, leading to better advertiser return on investment amidst increased activity in key sectors such as financial services and retail. Additionally, a noted improvement in monetization efforts on YouTube and a robust trajectory in core search operations contribute to the overall optimism regarding the company’s financial

outlook for Amazon.com is clouded by multiple concerning factors, including a lowered fiscal year 2025 revenue estimate of $699.4 billion, representing only a 10% year-over-year growth, and a corresponding reduction in earnings per share (EPS) to $6.10. Despite the historically strong performance of the fourth quarter, product sales have stagnated between $61 billion and $67 billion in the three preceding quarters since the first quarter of 2021, raising concerns about sustained growth. Additionally, adjustments such as the lowering of server useful life, expected to decrease operating income by approximately $700 million, alongside foreign exchange impacts and a potential economic slowdown, suggest that Amazon's stock may face vulnerabilities in its trading multiples."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com displays a robust financial outlook, driven by a significant 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), achieving $28.8 billion in 4Q24, alongside a notable 48% increase in operating income, which indicates a strong operating margin of 37%. The company's retail and service revenues are experiencing positive momentum, with service revenues accounting for 56% of total sales and showing potential for valuation multiple expansion, while advertising revenue has surged to an annualized run rate of $69 billion, reflecting an 18% increase year-over-year. Additionally, the continued growth in Prime membership and enhancements in operational efficiency, alongside management's expectations for easing AWS capacity constraints in the near future, contribute to an encouraging financial landscape for Amazon."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the
