For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

annual dollar retention rate has declined to 86%, reflecting a strategic shift toward reducing less profitable home insurance customers, which may adversely affect overall growth potential. Additionally, macroeconomic risks, particularly related to increased unemployment and consolidating households, pose significant obstacles as these factors could lead to decreased demand for essential insurance products amid a potential prolonged recession. Despite the company's significant market opportunity in home insurance, the reported gross loss ratio of 63% highlights ongoing financial challenges that could hinder the path to profitability."],"bullsSay":["Lemonade Inc concluded a strong FY24, achieving its best quarter ever in 4Q, with in-force premium growth of 26.3% year-over-year and a customer count increase of 20%, reaching 2.43 million customers. The company's operational metrics improved significantly, with the TTM gross loss ratio declining for six consecutive quarters and an adjusted cash flow positivity maintained for the third quarter, indicating robust underlying unit economics and effective cost management through technology. Additionally, management's positive guidance for FY25 targets, including a projected 27.5%-28% growth in in-force premiums and continued revenue growth of 24.4%-24.8%, underscores Lemonade's strong

facing a challenging financial outlook, as evidenced by its adjusted EBIT margin guidance of 13.4%, which is approximately 40 basis points lower than prior expectations due to several factors, including sales deleverage and a negative mix shift from its recent acquisition of SRS. Furthermore, the company's gross margins have decreased by 25 basis points year-over-year, exacerbated by a significant decline in lumber prices and a drop in housing affordability that has dampened homebuilding demand. Additionally, the forecast for adjusted diluted EPS reflects a projected decline of about 2%, underscoring the potential adverse effects of sustained interest rate increases on home improvement activity and overall financial performance."],"bullsSay":["Home Depot, as the world’s largest home improvement specialty retailer, has consistently demonstrated higher and more stable sales and earnings growth compared to its primary peer, Lowe's, which has allowed it to command a premium valuation in the marketplace. The prolonged rise in home prices, which have increased for 19 consecutive months and remain substantially above pre-pandemic levels, is anticipated to provide a favorable backdrop for growth in the home improvement industry, complemented by potential benefits from current lumber prices and tariffs.

Interactive Inc. has reported a significant decline in connected fitness product sales, dropping 21% year-over-year to $253 million, which raises concerns about the sustainability of its revenue streams amidst increasing reliance on subscription services. While churn rates for connected fitness subscribers decreased to 1.4%, the firm is still projected to experience a 7% decline in connected fitness subscribers in FY'25E, with a return to growth not expected until FY'29E. Additionally, total sales fell by 9% to $674 million, reflecting continued challenges in both hardware sales and the overall subscription market, suggesting persistent headwinds for Peloton's financial performance."],"bullsSay":["Peloton Interactive Inc. reported a significant gross margin of 47.2%, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 690 basis points, which exceeded both internal guidance and market expectations, indicative of strong performance in its Connected Fitness Subscription segment. The company's forecast for FY26 anticipates a modest sales increase to $2.50 billion, with expectations for the percentage of gross profit from subscriptions to rise from approximately 35% to 60% over time, emphasizing the growing importance of this revenue stream. Enhanced profitability in the recent quarter, driven by improved marketing efficiency and robust unit economics, has led to a notable upward revision of the company's adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance, reinforcing a positive outlook for Peloton's financial trajectory."],"charts":[{"title":"Connected Fitness Subscribers","description":null,"chartType":"VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"NUMBER","valueMultiplier":1000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Connected Fitness Subscribers","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":2330.7},{"key":"22 Q1","value":2491.7},{"key":"22 Q2","value":2766.8},{"key":"22 Q3","value":2962},{"key":"22 Q4","value":2966},{"key":"23 Q1","value":2973},{"key":"23 Q2","value":3033},{"key":"23 Q3","value":3107},{"key":"23 Q4","value":3078},{"key":"24 Q1","value":2964},{"key":"24 Q2","value":3004},{"key":"24 Q3","value":3056},{"key":"24 Q4","value":2981},{"key":"25 Q1","value":2900},{"key":"25 Q2","value":2879},{"key":"25 Q3","value":2880}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Connected Fitness Products","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":655.3},{"key":"22 Q1","value":501},{"key":"22 Q2","value":796.4},{"key":"22 Q3","value":594.4},{"key":"22 Q4","value":295.6},{"key":"23 Q1","value":204.2},{"key":"23 Q2","value":381.4},{"key":"23 Q3","value":324.1},{"key":"23 Q4","value":220.4},{"key":"24 Q1","value":180.6},{"key":"24 Q2","value":319.1},{"key":"24 Q3","value":279.9},{"key":"24 Q4","value":212.1},{"key":"25 Q1","value":159.6},{"key":"25 Q2","value":253.4},{"key":"25 Q3","value":205.5}]},{"title":"Subscription","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":281.6},{"key":"22 Q1","value":304.1},{"key":"22 Q2","value":337.5},{"key":"22 Q3","value":369.9},{"key":"22 Q4","value":383.1},{"key":"23 Q1","value":412.3},{"key":"23 Q2","value":411.3},{"key":"23 Q3","value":424.7},{"key":"23 Q4","value":421.7},{"key":"24 Q1","value":415},{"key":"24 Q2","value":424.5},{"key":"24 Q3","value":437.8},{"key":"24 Q4","value":431.4},{"key":"25 Q1","value":426.3},{"key":"25 Q2","value":420.6},{"key":"25 Q3","value":418.5}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":27.06},{"key":"22 Q1","value":32.62},{"key":"22 Q2","value":24.71},{"key":"22 Q3","value":19.1},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-4.4},{"key":"23 Q1","value":35.23},{"key":"23 Q2","value":29.64},{"key":"23 Q3","value":36.08},{"key":"23 Q4","value":31.31},{"key":"24 Q1","value":47.91},{"key":"24 Q2","value":40.26},{"key":"24 Q3","value":43.15},{"key":"24 Q4","value":48.48},{"key":"25 Q1","value":51.85},{"key":"25 Q2","value":47.24},{"key":"25 Q3","value":50.97}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":-32.21},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-44.67},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-37.56},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-76.31},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-177.09},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-60.67},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-41.8},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-35.54},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-35.17},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-22.2},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-25.17},{"key":"24 Q3","value":-20.36},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-9.86},{"key":"25 Q1","value":2.15},{"key":"25 Q2","value":-6.82},{"key":"25 Q3","value":-5.21}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":-33.43},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-46.71},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-38.76},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-78.52},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-183.36},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-66.27},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-42.32},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-36.85},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-37.66},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-26.75},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-26.22},{"key":"24 Q3","value":-23.32},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-4.74},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-0.16},{"key":"25 Q2","value":-13.65},{"key":"25 Q3","value":-7.65}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

outlook for Amazon.com is clouded by multiple concerning factors, including a lowered fiscal year 2025 revenue estimate of $699.4 billion, representing only a 10% year-over-year growth, and a corresponding reduction in earnings per share (EPS) to $6.10. Despite the historically strong performance of the fourth quarter, product sales have stagnated between $61 billion and $67 billion in the three preceding quarters since the first quarter of 2021, raising concerns about sustained growth. Additionally, adjustments such as the lowering of server useful life, expected to decrease operating income by approximately $700 million, alongside foreign exchange impacts and a potential economic slowdown, suggest that Amazon's stock may face vulnerabilities in its trading multiples."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com displays a robust financial outlook, driven by a significant 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), achieving $28.8 billion in 4Q24, alongside a notable 48% increase in operating income, which indicates a strong operating margin of 37%. The company's retail and service revenues are experiencing positive momentum, with service revenues accounting for 56% of total sales and showing potential for valuation multiple expansion, while advertising revenue has surged to an annualized run rate of $69 billion, reflecting an 18% increase year-over-year. Additionally, the continued growth in Prime membership and enhancements in operational efficiency, alongside management's expectations for easing AWS capacity constraints in the near future,
