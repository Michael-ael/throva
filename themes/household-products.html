For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

The idea was to provide brand name quality products at discounted prices. To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding.

Foods's operating margins have declined to 3.6%, down from 4.5% the previous year, indicating weakening profitability within its core segments. Additionally, the company's sales decreased by 2.8% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, primarily driven by a 3.2% drop in volume, reflecting competitive pressures and lack of significant market share. Furthermore, projections from the USDA indicate a substantial 8.5% reduction in beef production in the latter half of 2025, which could lead to further supply chain challenges and margin compression for Tyson Foods."],"bullsSay":["Tyson Foods reported a revenue growth of 6.2% year-over-year, reaching $5.3 billion, driven by both a 0.6% increase in pricing and a notable 5.6% increase in volume, indicating resilient demand for its products. The company also demonstrated improved profitability, with adjusted operating margins rising to 9.1% from 4.8% in the previous year, highlighting effective cost management and operational efficiency.

Foods has experienced a decline in pork processing margins, with the average margin falling 38.5% year-over-year during F1Q25, signaling significant profitability challenges within its core meat-focused operations. Additionally, the company's retail operating margins have been adversely affected by persistent inflation in input costs and a shift in consumer demand towards lower-margin products, which has hindered its ability to mitigate rising expenses through price increases. Furthermore, lower farrowing intentions and a slight decrease in pork exports indicate ongoing weaknesses in market dynamics that could undermine future revenue growth."],"bullsSay":["Hormel Foods has demonstrated steady growth in its retail portfolio, with a 0.9% year-over-year increase in sales driven by strong performance in major brands such as Spam and Applegate. The company’s food service segment is projected to grow with a volume increase of 3% and a pricing uptick of 1% year-over-year, indicating broad-based growth across various categories.

stock faces a negative outlook due to several financial factors, including a 10 basis points decline in card penetration during the latest quarter and a year-over-year drop of 40 basis points in retail gross margin to 26.2%, attributed to increased digital fulfillment and supply chain costs. Furthermore, the company is anticipating a small year-over-year sales decline for Q1, compounded by weak consumer confidence and ongoing challenges in discretionary spending, which have contributed to underperformance relative to larger peers in the consumables category. Overall, despite Target maintaining its full-year EPS guidance within original expectations, early 2024 sales results have been disappointing, with February reflecting a small net decline in sales, suggesting weakening demand in a market with increasing economic pressures."],"bullsSay":["Target's strong market position as the seventh-largest retailer in the nation is highlighted by its ability to generate over $100 billion in sales and fulfill over 2 billion customer orders annually across more than 1,900 stores. The company has experienced significant growth in digital sales, with same-day services increasing by over 25% in the quarter, reflecting the success of its Target Circle 360 program and a broader trend in discretionary categories such as apparel, entertainment, and toys. Despite some pressure on average ticket size, the overall traffic increase of 2.1% and a modest expectation for EBIT margin expansion in 2025 further support a positive outlook for the company's financial performance."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Sales","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":24826},{"key":"21 Q3","value":25290},{"key":"21 Q4","value":30616},{"key":"22 Q1","value":24830},{"key":"22 Q2","value":25653},{"key":"22 Q3","value":26122},{"key":"22 Q4","value":30983},{"key":"23 Q1","value":24948},{"key":"23 Q2","value":24384},{"key":"23 Q3","value":25004},{"key":"23 Q4","value":31467},{"key":"24 Q1","value":24143},{"key":"24 Q2","value":25021},{"key":"24 Q3","value":25228},{"key":"24 Q4","value":30428},{"key":"25 Q1","value":23405}]},{"title":"Other revenue","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":334},{"key":"21 Q3","value":362},{"key":"21 Q4","value":380},{"key":"22 Q1","value":340},{"key":"22 Q2","value":384},{"key":"22 Q3","value":396},{"key":"22 Q4","value":412},{"key":"23 Q1","value":374},{"key":"23 Q2","value":389},{"key":"23 Q3","value":394},{"key":"23 Q4","value":452},{"key":"24 Q1","value":388},{"key":"24 Q2","value":431},{"key":"24 Q3","value":440},{"key":"24 Q4","value":487},{"key":"25 Q1","value":441}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":31.31},{"key":"21 Q3","value":29.02},{"key":"21 Q4","value":26.56},{"key":"22 Q1","value":26.65},{"key":"22 Q2","value":22.64},{"key":"22 Q3","value":25.78},{"key":"22 Q4","value":23.72},{"key":"23 Q1","value":27.39},{"key":"23 Q2","value":28.15},{"key":"23 Q3","value":28.54},{"key":"23 Q4","value":26.68},{"key":"24 Q1","value":28.86},{"key":"24 Q2","value":30.06},{"key":"24 Q3","value":28.41},{"key":"24 Q4","value":26.24},{"key":"25 Q1","value":28.17}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":9.8},{"key":"21 Q3","value":7.83},{"key":"21 Q4","value":6.75},{"key":"22 Q1","value":5.34},{"key":"22 Q2","value":1.23},{"key":"22 Q3","value":3.85},{"key":"22 Q4","value":3.69},{"key":"23 Q1","value":5.24},{"key":"23 Q2","value":4.83},{"key":"23 Q3","value":5.18},{"key":"23 Q4","value":5.84},{"key":"24 Q1","value":5.28},{"key":"24 Q2","value":6.42},{"key":"24 Q3","value":4.55},{"key":"24 Q4","value":4.74},{"key":"25 Q1","value":6.17}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":7.22},{"key":"21 Q3","value":5.8},{"key":"21 Q4","value":4.98},{"key":"22 Q1","value":4},{"key":"22 Q2","value":0.7},{"key":"22 Q3","value":2.68},{"key":"22 Q4","value":2.79},{"key":"23 Q1","value":3.75},{"key":"23 Q2","value":3.37},{"key":"23 Q3","value":3.82},{"key":"23 Q4","value":4.32},{"key":"24 Q1","value":3.84},{"key":"24 Q2","value":4.68},{"key":"24 Q3","value":3.32},{"key":"24 Q4","value":3.56},{"key":"25 Q1","value":4.34}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

has experienced significant pressure on its stock due to historical patterns, with its next twelve months price-to-earnings (NTM P/E) ratio contracting nearly 40% during the 2008-09 recession, suggesting vulnerability to economic downturns. Current operational challenges, including decelerating food volumes in China, shifts in Mexico tied to election-related socioeconomic factors, and adverse weather impacting parts of western Europe, have prompted a reduction in the company's organic growth estimates for fiscal year 2024 from 3.2% to 1.9%. Additionally, the company's overall underperformance relative to market expectations has fostered a negative sentiment regarding its financial outlook for 2025, with anticipated guidance remaining cautious."],"bullsSay":["PepsiCo's strong positioning in the global snacks and beverages market is underscored by its ownership of leading brands and its dominance in savory snacks, which drive approximately 55% of its total revenue. The recent improvement in the Frito segment's volumes, alongside a commitment to reinvest in advertising and promotion to stimulate consumer demand, illustrates the company's proactive approach to fostering growth despite current challenges. Furthermore, with international markets contributing 40% to total sales and operating profits, PepsiCo is well-positioned to leverage its diversified portfolio globally, enhancing its overall
