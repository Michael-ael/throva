For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

is negatively impacted by flat operating margin expectations, with guidance indicating a sequential decline to 45% for Q2 2025, primarily driven by a reported decrease in total RPO of $270 million and a -2.0% decline in total bookings. The company's slower growth rate compared to its large-cap technology peers, coupled with rising competitive pressures, justifies a cautious stance, particularly in light of potential risks such as increased pricing pressure and softening demand for digital media solutions amid an economic downturn. Furthermore, management's reluctance to quantify the impact of Cyberweek suggests uncertainty about future performance, exacerbating concerns regarding Adobe's market position and revenue stability."],"bullsSay":["Adobe's financial performance in the first quarter demonstrated robust growth, with total revenue reaching $5.71 billion, reflecting a 10% year-over-year increase, and surpassing consensus estimates.

Additionally, factors such as inflated valuations, heightened competition, and potential difficulties in content selection and retention could negatively impact Netflix's profitability and long-term cash flow projections."],"bullsSay":["Netflix's stock outlook remains positive due to its substantial growth in subscribers, adding 18.9 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter, which reflects the success of its content strategy and measures to combat account sharing. The company reported a revenue increase of 19% in constant currency to $10.25 billion, alongside a remarkable 52% year-over-year jump in operating profit to $2.27 billion, resulting in a significant rise in operating margin. Projections for 2025 indicate continued revenue growth of 14% to approximately $44.4 billion, with operating profit expected to reach $13.2 billion, further supported by controlled content costs and

Additionally, the Intelligent Edge segment has shown concerning performance, with sales remaining flat quarter-over-quarter but down 20.3% year-over-year, highlighting prolonged sales cycles and soft demand amid weaker enterprise spending expectations."],"bullsSay":["Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is demonstrating strong momentum in its core compute business, with Gen11 products now representing over two-thirds of compute revenue and a year-over-year growth in servers of 31.7%, largely driven by the demand for AI compute systems. The company has a positive outlook for its financial performance, as reflected in a 109 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 143 basis points year-over-year increase in operating margin, reaching 11.1%, supported by robust cost savings and gains in market share.

stock outlook is negatively impacted by a sequential decline in growth, with revenue growth dropping from 21% in the first quarter of 2024 to 13% in the second quarter, primarily due to the anniversary of a price increase for YouTube TV. Additionally, network revenues experienced a year-on-year decline of 5%, raising concerns over the sustainability of Alphabet's core advertising business. The forecast for Google Services' ad revenue indicates potential challenges in 2025 as the company faces tough comparatives from a strong financial services vertical performance throughout 2024."],"bullsSay":["Alphabet's stock outlook remains positive due to robust growth in its Google Services segment, which reported a 10% year-over-year revenue increase to $84.1 billion in the fourth quarter, accompanied by a 23% rise in operating income and a strong 39% operating margin. Additionally, growth in YouTube's subscription offerings and advertising revenues, contributing to a 14% increase in YouTube ad revenues to $10.5 billion, underscores the effectiveness of content acquisition strategies and user engagement. Furthermore, substantial capital expenditure of $14.3 billion, up 30% year-over-year, highlights Alphabet's commitment to enhancing its technical infrastructure, positioning the company for further

Instruments has projected a significant revenue decline of 7% quarter-over-quarter for the fourth quarter, which starkly contrasts with consensus expectations of only a 1% decline, suggesting weaker operational performance than anticipated. The guidance for gross margins is also concerning, with a forecasted decrease to 57.5% due to lower revenues and increased depreciation costs, indicating potential inefficiencies in their production processes. Additionally, macroeconomic factors pose a risk to revenue stability, as any downturn could adversely impact their primary Analog segment, which comprises 78% of third-quarter revenue, leading to further declines in profitability."],"bullsSay":["Texas Instruments demonstrates strong performance with a notable record in automotive revenues, especially in China, which has seen growth rates of approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter.

faces a negative outlook due to several fundamental challenges, including a first quarter gross profit projection of $2.32 billion, which falls below the consensus expectation of $2.39 billion. Additionally, growth trends for the Cash App service have been disappointing, as monthly active users remained flat year-over-year with lighter engagement metrics. Furthermore, the fiscal year 2025 gross profit expectation of at least $10.22 billion is also below consensus estimates, indicating potential difficulty in achieving growth targets amidst increasing macro uncertainties and competitive threats."],"bullsSay":["Block's stock benefits from continued positive trends in seller revenue and stronger gross payment volume (GPV) in the United States, with GPV rising approximately 7% attributed to improved customer retention and same store growth. The company shows robust financial health, ending 4Q24 with $10.7 billion in liquidity, allowing for significant ongoing share buyback initiatives while pursuing high-return investment opportunities.

faces a negative outlook primarily due to elevated valuation amidst falling revenue estimates, indicating a challenging financial future. For the first quarter of 2025, the company guided revenue to $12.2 billion, reflecting a 14.4% quarter-over-quarter decline and a 4.1% year-over-year decline, which is below internal and market expectations. Additionally, pressures on gross margin, with expectations set at 36.0%—significantly lower than the anticipated 39.3%—further highlight the financial headwinds facing the company, along with concerns over increasing competition and macroeconomic risks."],"bullsSay":["Intel's positive outlook is supported by a sequential revenue increase to $4.500 billion, reflecting a 3.4% growth quarter-over-quarter, driven by a higher mix of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wafers and stronger equipment sales. Additionally, the Intel Foundry business is experiencing growth, with an improved gross margin anticipated as the product mix shifts toward more profitable EUV wafers, aided by customers proactively hedging against potential tariffs. Furthermore, the overall recovery in buying patterns, particularly in traditional server markets, alongside favorable macroeconomic conditions and a resurgence in data-centric business demand,

guidance for F1Q26 total revenue of $9.71B-$9.76B, which reflects a year-over-year growth of only 6-7%, fell short of consensus estimates of $9.90B and indicates a downward revision in growth expectations. The company reported F4Q25 revenue of $9.993B, 50 basis points below consensus and driven by foreign exchange headwinds, highlighting growing challenges in maintaining revenue momentum. Additionally, factors such as a leadership transition, slower Agentforce adoption, increasing competition, and disappointing performance in certain product areas, particularly Tableau and MuleSoft, raise significant concerns about future revenue growth sustainability."],"bullsSay":["Salesforce's adjusted New Annual Contract Value (ACV) exhibited significant growth of 36% year-over-year, rebounding from an estimated -5% in the previous quarter, indicating a robust recovery and increasing demand for its services. Additionally, common Remaining Performance Obligations (cRPO) increased by 11% year-over-year in constant currency, buoyed by strong performances in Data Cloud and AI, as well as early renewals that contributed to an acceleration in growth rates. With a guidance for a non-GAAP operating margin expansion to 34% and expectations of a modest but increasing contribution from Agentforce in future fiscal periods, Salesforce demonstrates a positive trajectory toward operational efficiency and revenue growth."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the

outlook for Amazon.com is clouded by multiple concerning factors, including a lowered fiscal year 2025 revenue estimate of $699.4 billion, representing only a 10% year-over-year growth, and a corresponding reduction in earnings per share (EPS) to $6.10. Despite the historically strong performance of the fourth quarter, product sales have stagnated between $61 billion and $67 billion in the three preceding quarters since the first quarter of 2021, raising concerns about sustained growth. Additionally, adjustments such as the lowering of server useful life, expected to decrease operating income by approximately $700 million, alongside foreign exchange impacts and a potential economic slowdown, suggest that Amazon's stock may face vulnerabilities in its trading multiples."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com displays a robust financial outlook, driven by a significant 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), achieving $28.8 billion in 4Q24, alongside a notable 48% increase in operating income, which indicates a strong operating margin of 37%. The company's retail and service revenues are experiencing positive momentum, with service revenues accounting for 56% of total sales and showing potential for valuation multiple expansion, while advertising revenue has surged to an annualized run rate of $69 billion, reflecting an 18% increase year-over-year. Additionally, the continued growth in Prime membership and enhancements in operational efficiency, alongside management's expectations for easing AWS capacity constraints in the near future, contribute to an encouraging financial landscape for Amazon."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the
