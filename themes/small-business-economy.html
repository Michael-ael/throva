For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

outlook on DocuSign's stock is primarily driven by a deceleration in customer growth, with a quarterly addition of 30,000 customers stagnating compared to the previous quarter and reflecting a year-over-year decline from 40,000, ultimately leading to a total of 260,000 customers. Additionally, the company has provided weak margin guidance for FY26, anticipating gross margins of 80.5% to 81.5% and operating margins of 27.8% to 28.8%, both below market expectations, alongside a projected one percentage point headwind from cloud migration costs. Compounding these concerns, the challenges associated with attracting new customers, combined with the evolving competitive landscape and potential risks of data breaches, suggest that DocuSign's revenue growth may face significant limitations going forward."],"bullsSay":["DocuSign reported a total revenue increase of 9.0% year-over-year, exceeding consensus estimates, with subscription revenue growth at 8.9% year-over-year contributing to this positive performance. The company demonstrated strong financial health with operating cash flows of $307.9 million and a robust operating margin of 39.7%, which highlights effective cost management and operational efficiency. Despite mixed guidance for future quarters, the consistent revenue growth trajectory and solid cash flows position DocuSign favorably in the market, reinforcing a positive outlook for its stock."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Subscription","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q2","value":492.758},{"key":"22 Q3","value":528.573},{"key":"22 Q4","value":564.006},{"key":"23 Q1","value":569.251},{"key":"23 Q2","value":605.194},{"key":"23 Q3","value":624.055},{"key":"23 Q4","value":643.677},{"key":"24 Q1","value":639.307},{"key":"24 Q2","value":669.367},{"key":"24 Q3","value":682.352},{"key":"24 Q4","value":695.682},{"key":"25 Q1","value":691.483},{"key":"25 Q2","value":717.366},{"key":"25 Q3","value":734.693},{"key":"25 Q4","value":757.767},{"key":"26 Q1","value":746.202}]},{"title":"Professional Services \u0026 Other","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q2","value":19.086},{"key":"22 Q3","value":16.89},{"key":"22 Q4","value":16.822},{"key":"23 Q1","value":19.441},{"key":"23 Q2","value":16.99},{"key":"23 Q3","value":21.408},{"key":"23 Q4","value":15.899},{"key":"24 Q1","value":22.081},{"key":"24 Q2","value":18.32},{"key":"24 Q3","value":18.069},{"key":"24 Q4","value":16.704},{"key":"25 Q1","value":18.157},{"key":"25 Q2","value":18.661},{"key":"25 Q3","value":20.127},{"key":"25 Q4","value":18.485},{"key":"26 Q1","value":17.452}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q2","value":77.77},{"key":"22 Q3","value":78.73},{"key":"22 Q4","value":77.36},{"key":"23 Q1","value":77.5},{"key":"23 Q2","value":78.02},{"key":"23 Q3","value":79.93},{"key":"23 Q4","value":79.16},{"key":"24 Q1","value":79.36},{"key":"24 Q2","value":78.83},{"key":"24 Q3","value":79.63},{"key":"24 Q4","value":79.23},{"key":"25 Q1","value":78.94},{"key":"25 Q2","value":78.87},{"key":"25 Q3","value":79.26},{"key":"25 Q4","value":79.36},{"key":"26 Q1","value":79.4}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q2","value":-4.42},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-0.62},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-4.34},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-3.27},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-6.61},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-4.25},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-0.05},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-0.71},{"key":"24 Q2","value":0.96},{"key":"24 Q3","value":2.81},{"key":"24 Q4","value":1.39},{"key":"25 Q1","value":3.18},{"key":"25 Q2","value":7.85},{"key":"25 Q3","value":7.82},{"key":"25 Q4","value":7.78},{"key":"26 Q1","value":7.89}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q2","value":-4.99},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-1.05},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-5.25},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-4.65},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-7.25},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-4.63},{"key":"23 Q4","value":0.73},{"key":"24 Q1","value":0.08},{"key":"24 Q2","value":1.07},{"key":"24 Q3","value":5.54},{"key":"24 Q4","value":3.82},{"key":"25 Q1","value":4.75},{"key":"25 Q2","value":120.67},{"key":"25 Q3","value":8.26},{"key":"25 Q4","value":10.75},{"key":"26 Q1","value":9.43}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

experiencing a negative outlook, primarily due to a projected 10% decline in EBITDA estimates, driven by lower gross merchandise sales (GMS) and expected lower margins year-over-year amid increased investments in product development. The company guided a year-over-year GMS decline for the first quarter that aligns with disappointing results from the fourth quarter, which fell short of expectations largely attributed to consumer discretionary spending pressures and a focus on long-term initiatives rather than immediate growth. Additionally, there is evidence of declining buyer engagement, with total active buyers dropping by 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and a 6% reduction in GMS estimates for 2025, suggesting ongoing challenges for the company's marketing strategy and overall growth trajectory."],"bullsSay":["Etsy is positioned favorably within the e-commerce marketplace, with a projected consolidated gross merchandise volume of $12.5 billion in 2024, indicating its substantial footprint in the growing niche of vintage and craft goods. The company has demonstrated strong performance with gifting gross merchandise sales (GMS) growing to 29% of total GMS, alongside impressive year-over-year growth rates of 21% in Q3 and 22% in Q4.

analysis points to a troubling regulatory environment for Consolidated Edison, indicated by the potential deterioration in its relationship with regulators, which may compound existing challenges. This is further underscored by the utilities consistently reporting return on equity (ROE) figures below the national average, coupled with a forecasted downside in earnings due to under-performance in expected rate cases. Additionally, the restrictions on leveraging parent debt to support utility capital needs exacerbate the company’s financial flexibility, making it difficult to meet equity funding requirements amidst a backdrop of slowing rate base growth."],"bullsSay":["Consolidated Edison's stock outlook is positively influenced by its expected robust growth in earnings, driven by an anticipated increase in capital expenditures, which are projected to rise to approximately $6 billion from around $4 billion in preceding years. The company is entering a significant capital expenditure cycle, with expectations for a 6%+ rate base growth, which underscores its focus on improving gas infrastructure and overall system reliability.

growth expectations have been significantly dampened due to broader economic pressures, resulting in a projected low-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth for FY25, which reflects weakened consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, a disappointing iPhone 16 cycle has been exacerbated by intense competition and a deceleration in services growth, leading to lowered shipment projections for the iPhone in FY25 and FY26. Lastly, heightened negative sentiment surrounding Apple has been fueled by delays in advanced features like Siri, concerns over China tariffs, and an overall jittery tech stock environment, suggesting a challenging outlook for the company."],"bullsSay":["Apple exhibits a strong financial outlook driven by robust iPhone sales, with projections indicating the company will sell approximately 225 million to 230 million units in FY25, followed by growth towards 245 million to 250 million units in FY26. The firm anticipates a significant uptick in revenue from iPhones, surpassing 20% year-over-year growth, spurred by strong consumer demand and an upgrade cycle with the iPhone 16. Coupled with consistent double-digit growth in services, stable gross margins, and the introduction of new products, Apple's earnings could reach $8.20 in CY26 and exceed $9 by

Additionally, Twilio is navigating risks related to the slower-than-expected adoption of its emerging engagement application portfolio and a challenging macroeconomic environment, which could hinder its operational capabilities and overall growth trajectory."],"bullsSay":["Twilio reported a year-over-year increase in net sales revenue of 7.32%, rising from $4.15 billion to $4.46 billion for the 12 months ending December 2024, with Q4 2024 revenue showcasing an even stronger growth rate of 11% to reach a record $1.19 billion. The company's return on capital (ROC) showed improvement, rising from -2.46% to -0.82%, indicating enhanced operational efficiency and potential profitability moving forward.

stock outlook appears negative due to several fundamental factors, including a potential decline in its premium EV/revenue multiple and a faster-than-expected slowdown in subscription revenue growth. The company faces increased competition from industry giants like Microsoft and ServiceNow, which, combined with disappointing traction in general work management, could further hinder its market position. Additionally, Atlassian's evolving business model, reliance on a seat-based approach amid declining software developer employment, and the need for significant investments in its sales force and R\u0026D, pose risks to maintaining margins and overall financial performance."],"bullsSay":["Atlassian's positive financial outlook is underscored by a revised total revenue guidance increase of 200 basis points to a range of 18.5-19.0%, demonstrating strong growth momentum. The company also reported free cash flow growth of 21% year-over-year, amounting to $343 million, alongside an increase in fiscal year 2025 operating margin guidance to 23.5%, reflecting improved operational efficiencies despite higher R\u0026D investments. Additionally, the Data Center segment experienced a robust 32% year-over-year revenue growth, supported by strong renewals and large multi-year deals, alongside a non-GAAP gross margin of 85%, indicating effective cost management and enhanced profitability."],"charts":[{"title":"Customers","description":null,"chartType":"VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"NUMBER","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Customers","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":204754},{"key":"22 Q1","value":216500},{"key":"22 Q2","value":226521},{"key":"22 Q3","value":234575},{"key":"22 Q4","value":242623},{"key":"23 Q1","value":249173},{"key":"23 Q2","value":253177},{"key":"23 Q3","value":259775},{"key":"23 Q4","value":262337},{"key":"24 Q1","value":265000},{"key":"24 Q2","value":302000},{"key":"24 Q3","value":300000},{"key":"24 Q4","value":300000},{"key":"25 Q1","value":300000},{"key":"25 Q2","value":300000},{"key":"25 Q3","value":300000}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Subscription","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":385.51},{"key":"22 Q1","value":435.296},{"key":"22 Q2","value":508.987},{"key":"22 Q3","value":555.126},{"key":"22 Q4","value":597.297},{"key":"23 Q1","value":650.984},{"key":"23 Q2","value":711.199},{"key":"23 Q3","value":760.68},{"key":"23 Q4","value":799.713},{"key":"24 Q1","value":851.982},{"key":"24 Q2","value":932.181},{"key":"24 Q3","value":1071.355},{"key":"24 Q4","value":1068.871},{"key":"25 Q1","value":1131.948},{"key":"25 Q2","value":1213.248},{"key":"25 Q3","value":1272.876}]},{"title":"Maintenance","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":131.08},{"key":"22 Q1","value":130.59},{"key":"22 Q2","value":127.059},{"key":"22 Q3","value":120.333},{"key":"22 Q4","value":117.095},{"key":"23 Q1","value":113.565},{"key":"23 Q2","value":106.023},{"key":"23 Q3","value":94.225},{"key":"23 Q4","value":85.925},{"key":"24 Q1","value":78.598},{"key":"24 Q2","value":69.102},{"key":"24 Q3","value":29.53}]},{"title":"Perpetual License","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":9.237}]},{"title":"Other","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":33.712},{"key":"22 Q1","value":48.138},{"key":"22 Q2","value":52.48},{"key":"22 Q3","value":65.032},{"key":"22 Q4","value":45.449},{"key":"23 Q1","value":42.843},{"key":"23 Q2","value":55.482},{"key":"23 Q3","value":60.548},{"key":"23 Q4","value":53.46},{"key":"24 Q1","value":47.195},{"key":"24 Q2","value":58.827},{"key":"24 Q3","value":88.243},{"key":"24 Q4","value":62.719},{"key":"25 Q1","value":55.833},{"key":"25 Q2","value":73.215},{"key":"25 Q3","value":83.84}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":82.49},{"key":"22 Q1","value":84.03},{"key":"22 Q2","value":83.27},{"key":"22 Q3","value":83.87},{"key":"22 Q4","value":82.47},{"key":"23 Q1","value":82.73},{"key":"23 Q2","value":82.13},{"key":"23 Q3","value":81.57},{"key":"23 Q4","value":81.92},{"key":"24 Q1","value":81.79},{"key":"24 Q2","value":81.64},{"key":"24 Q3","value":82.05},{"key":"24 Q4","value":80.77},{"key":"25 Q1","value":81.67},{"key":"25 Q2","value":82.65},{"key":"25 Q3","value":83.8}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":-1.35},{"key":"22 Q1","value":6.45},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-9.69},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-2.18},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-8.33},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-4.22},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-11.38},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-17.65},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-5.37},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-1.93},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-4.63},{"key":"24 Q3","value":1.49},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-5.92},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-2.7},{"key":"25 Q2","value":-4.47},{"key":"25 Q3","value":-0.92}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q4","value":-38.09},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-65.17},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-11.26},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-4.2},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-13.88},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-1.71},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-23.5},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-22.84},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-6.28},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-3.27},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-7.97},{"key":"24 Q3","value":1.07},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-17.41},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-10.43},{"key":"25 Q2","value":-2.98},{"key":"25 Q3","value":-5.22}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

analysis indicates a negative outlook for Alphabet's stock primarily due to several financial headwinds, including flat capital expenditures of $13 billion expected to persist into the fourth quarter alongside anticipated substantial growth in 2025 that is projected to be less than the 60% growth experienced in 2024. There are anticipated challenges in fourth quarter advertising revenue, particularly stemming from tough comparisons with Asian retailers and a slowdown in consumer spending that could reduce advertising budgets. Additionally, increasing costs related to new projects, potential privacy regulations, and intensified competition are likely to adversely impact Alphabet’s financial performance and overall market position."],"bullsSay":["Alphabet's stock outlook is bolstered by strong performance across various segments, particularly with a 35% year-over-year revenue increase from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and positive shifts in operating income predictions for 2024 and 2025. Enhanced engagement driven by AI innovations is significantly improving consumer intent understanding, leading to better advertiser return on investment amidst increased activity in key sectors such as financial services and retail. Additionally, a noted improvement in monetization efforts on YouTube and a robust trajectory in core search operations contribute to the overall optimism regarding the company’s financial

Additionally, growth trends for the Cash App service have been disappointing, as monthly active users remained flat year-over-year with lighter engagement metrics. Furthermore, the fiscal year 2025 gross profit expectation of at least $10.22 billion is also below consensus estimates, indicating potential difficulty in achieving growth targets amidst increasing macro uncertainties and competitive threats."],"bullsSay":["Block's stock benefits from continued positive trends in seller revenue and stronger gross payment volume (GPV) in the United States, with GPV rising approximately 7% attributed to improved customer retention and same store growth.

analysis reveals a concerning outlook for HubSpot's stock based on several key metrics. The company anticipates a shrinking install base into FY25, which is compounded by a significant foreign exchange (FX) headwind and challenges related to customer churn from legacy Clearbit accounts, directly influencing revenue guidance. Furthermore, the average subscription revenue per customer (ASRPC) experienced a decline, reflecting a stagnant growth environment that may hinder the company's overall financial performance moving forward."],"bullsSay":["HubSpot's financial performance reflects a positive outlook, highlighted by a sequential increase in net revenue retention of 200 basis points to 104%, primarily driven by the newly implemented seat-based pricing model. The company also achieved significant gross margin expansion, with a year-over-year increase of 100 basis points to 86.7%, alongside a notable turnaround in services margin, which improved dramatically by approximately 2,730 basis points.

The bank's net interest income (NII) has shown a significant growth trajectory, with a reported $14.1 billion in Q3 2024 and ongoing increases expected as the bank's securities portfolio is repriced, leading to improved yields.
