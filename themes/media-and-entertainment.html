For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

The firm also risks further performance deterioration influenced by external factors such as geopolitical instability, fluctuating foreign exchange rates, and potential health crises impacting attendance at events."],"bullsSay":["Live Nation Entertainment has demonstrated robust growth, with fan count increasing by 4% to 39.1 million, driven by an impressive 18% international growth, suggesting strong market penetration abroad.

Additionally, a revision in the medium-term outlook indicates expectations of diminished Internet growth, increased postpaid churn, and ongoing multiple compression in a high-interest-rate environment, all contributing to a negative financial outlook for BCE."],"bullsSay":["BCE's positive outlook is supported by a robust increase in both Internet revenue and subscribers, with a year-over-year growth of 3.3% in Internet revenue and a 10% increase in residential Internet customers on fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) connections.

Technology is experiencing a deceleration in subscription average revenue per user (ARPU), with growth now at 7% in constant currency, down from 11% in the previous quarter, indicating challenges from tougher year-over-year comparisons. The company's 1Q25 revenue guidance reflects a forecasted 15% growth in constant currency, which is a 200 basis points slowdown from the prior period, suggesting that revenue growth may further decline due to reduced ARPU amid rising price pressures. Additionally, concerns surrounding royalty payments, subdued advertising growth against tough comparisons, and a recent reduction in full-time staff by 21% indicate potential downward pressure on margins and operating profit, raising doubts about Spotify's ability to sustain strong financial performance moving forward."],"bullsSay":["Spotify Technology is recognized as the leading global music streaming service, boasting nearly 700 million monthly active users and over 250 million paying subscribers, from whom it derives the majority of its revenue and nearly all its gross profit. The firm has shown strong financial performance, with a gross margin rise forecasted at 390 basis points year-over-year, reaching 31.5%, alongside an anticipated operating profit of €548 million, marking an operating margin increase of 840 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, the continued growth of premium revenue at approximately 18% year-over-year and ad-supported revenue at about 27.5% underscores Spotify's pricing power and effectiveness in monetizing its advertising capabilities."],"charts":[{"title":"Monthly Active

outlook for Snap is negatively impacted by uncertainties surrounding profitability in its VR/AR initiatives, which may continue to incur cash burn longer than anticipated. Additionally, revisions to expected revenues for 4Q24 and 2024/2025 indicate a downward trend, with projected revenue figures lowered from $1.55 billion to $1.535 billion, reflecting ongoing challenges in advertiser return on investment and engagement trends. Furthermore, headwinds associated with Amazon DSP integration are expected to affect near-term revenue and adjusted EBITDA profitability, compounding concerns about the overall financial health of the company."],"bullsSay":["Snap demonstrates a positive outlook due to anticipated improvements in creator monetization, expected to gain momentum beginning in the first half of 2025, supported by the integration of Sponsored Snap and Promoted Places. The steady rise in monthly active users (MAUs) and the increased time spent on the platform during the second half of 2024 indicates growing user engagement, enhancing Snap's appeal to advertisers. Additionally, the resilient growth of direct response (DR) budgets, increasing by 16% in both the second and third quarters of 2024, positions Snap favorably for sustainable revenue growth through

Additionally, the forecast now anticipates a net loss of 506,000 broadband subscribers by 2025, worsening from an earlier projection of a loss of 322,000, which further decreases the EPS estimate for fiscal year 2026 from $4.95 to $4.74.

faces a negative outlook primarily due to increasing competition in the TV operating system market, highlighted by significant players such as Amazon, Google, and Walmart, which have the financial resources to subsidize their platforms. Additionally, tensions with major streaming services regarding fee and data disputes, such as the YouTube TV situation, create potential risks for Roku's growth and market share, especially as consolidation among streaming providers continues to limit the diversity of content available on its platform. Furthermore, the reliance on a few key retail partners for device sales, accounting for 71% of revenue in 2023, poses additional vulnerability, as changes in relationships with these partners could significantly impact Roku's financial performance."],"bullsSay":["Roku demonstrated strong financial performance in 4Q24, reporting revenue of $1.201 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase, and exceeding internal guidance by approximately $60 million. The Roku Channel achieved notable success, representing 4.9% of U.S. streaming time, which reflects a 2.1 point year-over-year gain, fueled by enhanced content partnerships and user experience improvements. The company’s robust platform revenue growth of 25% year-over-year, management's commitment to further accelerating this growth, and its substantial cash reserves of over $2 billion with no debt, also underscore a positive outlook for Roku's financial stability and operational efficiency moving forward."],"charts":[{"title":"Streaming

Additionally, factors such as inflated valuations, heightened competition, and potential difficulties in content selection and retention could negatively impact Netflix's profitability and long-term cash flow projections."],"bullsSay":["Netflix's stock outlook remains positive due to its substantial growth in subscribers, adding 18.9 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter, which reflects the success of its content strategy and measures to combat account sharing.
