For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

has experienced a downward revision in its financial projections, with 2024 revenue now modeled at $175.5 million, down from a prior estimate of $183.3 million, reflecting management's guidance for stagnation in growth.

Following disappointing third-quarter results, including an EBITDA decrease to $8.1 million from an earlier estimate of $15.8 million and a significant drop in gross revenue to $49.7 million compared to previous expectations, the stock has declined 27.1%, indicating significant investor concern about future performance."],"bullsSay":["Boxlight Corp has reported an improvement in its gross margin, rising to 34.5%, which exceeded expectations and reflects effective cost management strategies.

stock outlook is negatively impacted by a sequential decline in growth, with revenue growth dropping from 21% in the first quarter of 2024 to 13% in the second quarter, primarily due to the anniversary of a price increase for YouTube TV. Additionally, network revenues experienced a year-on-year decline of 5%, raising concerns over the sustainability of Alphabet's core advertising business. The forecast for Google Services' ad revenue indicates potential challenges in 2025 as the company faces tough comparatives from a strong financial services vertical performance throughout 2024."],"bullsSay":["Alphabet's stock outlook remains positive due to robust growth in its Google Services segment, which reported a 10% year-over-year revenue increase to $84.1 billion in the fourth quarter, accompanied by a 23% rise in operating income and a strong 39% operating margin. Additionally, growth in YouTube's subscription offerings and advertising revenues, contributing to a 14% increase in YouTube ad revenues to $10.5 billion, underscores the effectiveness of content acquisition strategies and user engagement. Furthermore, substantial capital expenditure of $14.3 billion, up 30% year-over-year, highlights Alphabet's commitment to enhancing its technical infrastructure, positioning the company for further

For the full year, Roblox's midpoint was $35 million below the consensus estimate of $5,285 million, indicating continued challenges in revenue generation. Additionally, difficult year-over-year comparisons, influenced by the strong performance of competitor platforms and transaction trends, further complicate the company's outlook for Q1 2025 bookings, which are already expected to be hindered by a tougher comparison due to the timing of Easter."],"bullsSay":["Roblox demonstrated strong financial performance with a year-over-year increase in daily active users (DAUs) of 19%, reaching 85.3 million, which contributed to a revenue growth of over 20%. The company also reported a notable acceleration in bookings in December, with a 25% increase year-over-year driven by engaging content and strong performance from top monetizing experiences.
