For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

has experienced an 8.4% EBIT margin in fiscal 2024, marking a year-over-year decline of approximately 70 basis points, alongside an EPS of $0.44, which fell short of expansion expectations amid a gross margin decline of about 10 basis points. The company anticipates flat EBIT margins in the first quarter of 2025, as growth investments are expected to offset any gross margin expansions, with additional operational costs stemming from new distribution center opening further impacting profitability. Additionally, adverse weather conditions in late 2023 negatively affected seasonal product performance, and an increase in the SG\u0026A expense ratio by 60 basis points highlights the ongoing pressure on profit margins."],"bullsSay":["Tractor Supply is projecting a sales increase of 5%-7% for fiscal 2025, benefiting from improved big-ticket trends, market share gains, and expanding gross margins expected to rise by 20-40 basis points year-over-year to between 36.5%-36.7%, driven by enhanced supply chain efficiencies and cost management. The company's total sales per store have improved significantly since 2019, increasing from $4.5 million to $6.5 million, indicating strong operational performance and the effectiveness of initiatives such as new store openings and remodels. Additionally, the favorable end market environment, combined with the company's strategy to navigate post-pandemic sales dynamics, suggests potential for ongoing comparable store sales growth and robust EBITDA growth in the coming years."],"charts":[{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":35.96},{"key":"21 Q4","value":33.75},{"key":"22 Q1","value":34.93},{"key":"22 Q2","value":35.51},{"key":"22 Q3","value":35.64},{"key":"22 Q4","value":34.03},{"key":"23 Q1","value":35.46},{"key":"23 Q2","value":36.19},{"key":"23 Q3","value":36.64},{"key":"23 Q4","value":35.33},{"key":"24 Q1","value":35.96},{"key":"24 Q2","value":36.63},{"key":"24 Q3","value":37.2},{"key":"24 Q4","value":35.23},{"key":"25 Q1","value":36.21},{"key":"25 Q2","value":36.93}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":9.84},{"key":"21 Q4","value":8.82},{"key":"22 Q1","value":8.07},{"key":"22 Q2","value":13.45},{"key":"22 Q3","value":9.36},{"key":"22 Q4","value":8.96},{"key":"23 Q1","value":7.4},{"key":"23 Q2","value":13.36},{"key":"23 Q3","value":9.99},{"key":"23 Q4","value":9.13},{"key":"24 Q1","value":7.75},{"key":"24 Q2","value":13.22},{"key":"24 Q3","value":9.35},{"key":"24 Q4","value":8.43},{"key":"25 Q1","value":7.18},{"key":"25 Q2","value":13.01}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":7.43},{"key":"21 Q4","value":6.66},{"key":"22 Q1","value":6.19},{"key":"22 Q2","value":10.15},{"key":"22 Q3","value":7.15},{"key":"22 Q4","value":6.76},{"key":"23 Q1","value":5.54},{"key":"23 Q2","value":10.06},{"key":"23 Q3","value":7.47},{"key":"23 Q4","value":6.77},{"key":"24 Q1","value":5.83},{"key":"24 Q2","value":10.01},{"key":"24 Q3","value":6.96},{"key":"24 Q4","value":6.26},{"key":"25 Q1","value":5.17},{"key":"25 Q2","value":9.68}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

faces significant challenges in its operations, particularly due to the termination of the Turkey master franchise agreement, which has led to 538 closures, alongside 200 additional closures in the Pizza Hut segment, creating an uncertain outlook for future growth. Despite a projected 5% long-term net restaurant growth, international development headwinds and a tough sales environment in 2024 contribute to a decelerating sales trend, as evidenced by declines in sales across its major brands, including a 2% drop in Pizza Hut's sales and a notable slowdown in KFC's international growth. With increased competition in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) market resulting in margin compression and reduced pricing power, Yum Brands' ability to maintain its financial performance and investor appeal is further compromised, leading to a cautious outlook on its stock."],"bullsSay":["Yum Brands is projecting significant growth for its Taco Bell brand, with plans to expand to 10,000 U.S. locations from the current 7,600, achieving approximately 200 net new openings annually between 2021 and 2024. The company anticipates an increase in company margins from 24.2% in 2024 to 25%-26% by 2030, supported by enhanced profitability among franchisees and the strategic rollout of high-margin offerings such as Live Mas Cafés.

analysis indicates a negative outlook on McDonald's stock, largely due to a fourth-quarter EPS of $2.83 falling slightly short of the consensus estimate, driven by lower company margins and increased operating expenses. The firm's guidance points to a decreased 2025 EPS estimate of $12.39, reflecting challenges such as food safety recovery efforts that contracted store-level margins by 170 basis points and a decline in same-store sales of 1.4%. Additionally, key risks remain prevalent, including deteriorating economic conditions, slower growth in EBITDA and free cash flow, and a reduced operating margin estimate for 2025, which underscores concerns over the company's performance trajectory and competitive positioning in the industry."],"bullsSay":["McDonald's, as the largest restaurant owner-operator globally, generated system sales of $131 billion in 2024 from over 43,000 stores across 115 markets, with approximately 60% of its revenue derived from franchise royalty fees and lease payments. The company's strategic initiatives, including enhancing value platforms and product innovation, are expected to bolster same-store sales (SSS) growth, with notable increases projected in both the International Operated Markets (IOM) and International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDLM) segments.

has experienced significant pressure on its stock due to historical patterns, with its next twelve months price-to-earnings (NTM P/E) ratio contracting nearly 40% during the 2008-09 recession, suggesting vulnerability to economic downturns. Current operational challenges, including decelerating food volumes in China, shifts in Mexico tied to election-related socioeconomic factors, and adverse weather impacting parts of western Europe, have prompted a reduction in the company's organic growth estimates for fiscal year 2024 from 3.2% to 1.9%. Additionally, the company's overall underperformance relative to market expectations has fostered a negative sentiment regarding its financial outlook for 2025, with anticipated guidance remaining cautious."],"bullsSay":["PepsiCo's strong positioning in the global snacks and beverages market is underscored by its ownership of leading brands and its dominance in savory snacks, which drive approximately 55% of its total revenue. The recent improvement in the Frito segment's volumes, alongside a commitment to reinvest in advertising and promotion to stimulate consumer demand, illustrates the company's proactive approach to fostering growth despite current challenges. Furthermore, with international markets contributing 40% to total sales and operating profits, PepsiCo is well-positioned to leverage its diversified portfolio globally, enhancing its overall
