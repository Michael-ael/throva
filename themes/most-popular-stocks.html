For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

outlook for Palantir Technologies appears negative due to anticipated macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, which could dampen enterprise AI spending and impact overall revenue growth. Additionally, the company's significant reliance on U.S. government budgets raises concerns as recent policy shifts, including a proposed 8% cut in defense spending, could further constrain its growth trajectory through 2025 and beyond. Furthermore, management has indicated challenges in European market adoption, highlighting the potential for stagnant growth in that region, which is critical for the company’s expansion strategy."],"bullsSay":["Palantir Technologies has demonstrated significant revenue growth, with government revenue reaching $455 million, a 40.4% year-over-year increase, and U.S. commercial revenue soaring by 64% year-over-year, driven by the continuous demand for AI and software offerings. Overall, the company's revenue forecast for fiscal year 2025 is projected between $3.741 and $3.757 billion, reflecting a robust 31% increase, alongside expectations for U.S. commercial revenue to exceed $1.079 billion, up 54%.

outlook is casts a shadow due to multiple factors contributing to potential revenue pressure, including a modest decline in operating margins to 69.3% and mixed performance in revenue streams, as Data Processing and Service revenue fell short of expectations. The company's vulnerability to economic downturns suggests that any slowdown in payment volume growth could severely impact revenue and earnings per share, particularly amidst a backdrop of increasing regulatory risks and disintermediation from alternative payment methods. Additionally, ongoing litigation concerning card fees may result in costly compensatory damages and regulatory changes that could further hinder Visa's financial performance."],"bullsSay":["Visa's strong growth metrics demonstrate its robust position as the world's largest payment processor, processing almost $16 trillion in fiscal 2024 across more than 200 countries. Notably, value-added services revenue rose by 18% and new flows revenue by 19% year-over-year, reflecting consistent demand and operational efficiency, while cross-border volumes increased by 16% year-over-year. Moreover, Visa's projected adjusted net revenue growth of low-double-digit percentage in FY25 indicates a positive trajectory, supported by the ongoing shift from paper-based to card payments, suggesting a favorable outlook for sustained market share expansion."],"charts":[{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":66.29},{"key":"21 Q4","value":65.78},{"key":"22 Q1","value":67.65},{"key":"22 Q2","value":66.79},{"key":"22 Q3","value":57.01},{"key":"22 Q4","value":65.32},{"key":"23 Q1","value":64.13},{"key":"23 Q2","value":66.82},{"key":"23 Q3","value":61.84},{"key":"23 Q4","value":64.46},{"key":"24 Q1","value":68.95},{"key":"24 Q2","value":61.01},{"key":"24 Q3","value":66.71},{"key":"24 Q4","value":66.01},{"key":"25 Q1","value":65.55},{"key":"25 Q2","value":56.64}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q3","value":42},{"key":"21 Q4","value":54.64},{"key":"22 Q1","value":56.08},{"key":"22 Q2","value":50.73},{"key":"22 Q3","value":46.88},{"key":"22 Q4","value":50.59},{"key":"23 Q1","value":52.65},{"key":"23 Q2","value":53.31},{"key":"23 Q3","value":51.16},{"key":"23 Q4","value":54.37},{"key":"24 Q1","value":56.63},{"key":"24 Q2","value":53.13},{"key":"24 Q3","value":54.74},{"key":"24 Q4","value":55.29},{"key":"25 Q1","value":53.82},{"key":"25 Q2","value":47.7}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

The company plans to increase its capital expenditures (CapEx) significantly from approximately $30 billion in 2024 to a range of $38 billion to $42 billion in 2025, reflecting the growing importance of packaging CapEx, which is expected to outpace overall CapEx growth.

outlook on Meta Platforms's stock primarily stems from concerns regarding its ability to maintain profitability amid high capital expenditure and depreciation levels, which may impede future profitability despite the company's significant investment in AI. Additionally, the guidance for revenue in the upcoming quarter is 3% below consensus expectations, signaling potential growth deceleration and raising doubts about monetization capabilities from its AI investments. Furthermore, numerous risks, including the end of the cost-cutting era and challenges in competing with cloud providers for AI monetization, further contribute to skepticism about Meta's long-term financial health."],"bullsSay":["Meta Platforms demonstrates a solid financial performance with advertising revenues reaching $46.8 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 21% and exceeding consensus estimates by 3%.

Additionally, with net sales revenue for the 12 months ending December 2024 projected to rise to $164.50 billion, and further anticipated growth to $194.78 billion, Meta's robust user engagement and

outlook for Amazon.com is clouded by multiple concerning factors, including a lowered fiscal year 2025 revenue estimate of $699.4 billion, representing only a 10% year-over-year growth, and a corresponding reduction in earnings per share (EPS) to $6.10. Despite the historically strong performance of the fourth quarter, product sales have stagnated between $61 billion and $67 billion in the three preceding quarters since the first quarter of 2021, raising concerns about sustained growth. Additionally, adjustments such as the lowering of server useful life, expected to decrease operating income by approximately $700 million, alongside foreign exchange impacts and a potential economic slowdown, suggest that Amazon's stock may face vulnerabilities in its trading multiples."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com displays a robust financial outlook, driven by a significant 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), achieving $28.8 billion in 4Q24, alongside a notable 48% increase in operating income, which indicates a strong operating margin of 37%. The company's retail and service revenues are experiencing positive momentum, with service revenues accounting for 56% of total sales and showing potential for valuation multiple expansion, while advertising revenue has surged to an annualized run rate of $69 billion, reflecting an 18% increase year-over-year. Additionally, the continued growth in Prime membership and enhancements in operational efficiency, alongside management's expectations for easing AWS capacity constraints in the near future,

Technologies faces a challenging outlook due to potential credit weaknesses stemming from a prolonged economic downturn, which may lead to negative fair value marks and higher provisions for loan losses. The company's net interest margin (NIM) of 5.57% is currently below prior estimates and has seen a year-over-year decline, indicating pressure on profitability as deposits are allocated to lower-yielding assets. Additionally, a slowdown in the growth of technology products and fee income, combined with increased credit losses, poses risks to SoFi's overall earnings and capital ratios."],"bullsSay":["SoFi Technologies has revised its FY24 net revenue expectations upward to $2.535-$2.550 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 22-23% year-over-year, which is a notable increase from the previous guidance. The company's strong performance in the fourth quarter of FY24 included GAAP revenue of $734.1 million, representing a 19.3% year-over-year increase and surpassing both estimates and consensus figures. Additionally, projected EBITDA and TBV growth further underline SoFi's positive trajectory, with expectations of $640-$645 million in EBITDA and a TBV increase of $1.00-$1.05 billion, supported by robust loan sale revenue and capital-light loan platform fees."],"charts":[{"title":"Members","description":null,"chartType":"VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"NUMBER","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Members","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":2.56},{"key":"21 Q3","value":2.937},{"key":"21 Q4","value":3.46},{"key":"22 Q1","value":3.868},{"key":"22 Q2","value":4.319},{"key":"22 Q3","value":4.743},{"key":"22 Q4","value":5.223},{"key":"23 Q1","value":5.656},{"key":"23 Q2","value":6.24},{"key":"23 Q3","value":6.957},{"key":"23 Q4","value":7.542},{"key":"24 Q1","value":8.132},{"key":"24 Q2","value":8.774},{"key":"24 Q3","value":9.373},{"key":"24 Q4","value":10.127},{"key":"25 Q1","value":10.916}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Lending","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":166.291},{"key":"21 Q3","value":210.291},{"key":"21 Q4","value":213.764},{"key":"22 Q1","value":252.989},{"key":"22 Q2","value":257.117},{"key":"22 Q3","value":301.694},{"key":"22 Q4","value":328.191},{"key":"23 Q1","value":337.081},{"key":"23 Q2","value":331.441},{"key":"23 Q3","value":348.973},{"key":"23 Q4","value":353.126},{"key":"24 Q1","value":330.476},{"key":"24 Q2","value":340.705},{"key":"24 Q3","value":396.245},{"key":"24 Q4","value":417.796},{"key":"25 Q1","value":413.373}]},{"title":"Technology Platform","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":45.297},{"key":"21 Q3","value":50.225},{"key":"21 Q4","value":53.299},{"key":"22 Q1","value":60.805},{"key":"22 Q2","value":83.899},{"key":"22 Q3","value":84.777},{"key":"22 Q4","value":85.652},{"key":"23 Q1","value":77.887},{"key":"23 Q2","value":87.623},{"key":"23 Q3","value":89.923},{"key":"23 Q4","value":96.907},{"key":"24 Q1","value":94.366},{"key":"24 Q2","value":95.438},{"key":"24 Q3","value":102.539},{"key":"24 Q4","value":102.835},{"key":"25 Q1","value":103.427}]},{"title":"Financial Services","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":17.039},{"key":"21 Q3","value":12.62},{"key":"21 Q4","value":21.956},{"key":"22 Q1","value":23.543},{"key":"22 Q2","value":30.363},{"key":"22 Q3","value":48.953},{"key":"22 Q4","value":64.817},{"key":"23 Q1","value":81.101},{"key":"23 Q2","value":98.052},{"key":"23 Q3","value":118.247},{"key":"23 Q4","value":139.115},{"key":"24 Q1","value":150.551},{"key":"24 Q2","value":176.132},{"key":"24 Q3","value":238.308},{"key":"24 Q4","value":256.52},{"key":"25 Q1","value":303.119}]},{"title":"Other","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":2.647},{"key":"21 Q3","value":-1.13},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-3.411},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-6.993},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-8.852},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-11.439},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-21.981},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-23.911},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-19.098},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-19.934},{"key":"23 Q4","value":26.256},{"key":"24 Q1","value":69.602},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-13.657},{"key":"24 Q3","value":-39.971},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-43.026},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-48.16}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":-71.52},{"key":"21 Q3","value":-10.98},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-38.33},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-33.18},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-26.41},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-17.56},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-8.53},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-7.64},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-9.91},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-49.69},{"key":"23 Q4","value":8.31},{"key":"24 Q1","value":14.6},{"key":"24 Q2","value":2.56},{"key":"24 Q3","value":9.15},{"key":"24 Q4","value":8.16},{"key":"25 Q1","value":10.33}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":-71.48},{"key":"21 Q3","value":-11.05},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-38.87},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-33.41},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-26.44},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-17.51},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-8.77},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-7.3},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-9.55},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-49.65},{"key":"23 Q4","value":7.78},{"key":"24 Q1","value":13.65},{"key":"24 Q2","value":2.9},{"key":"24 Q3","value":8.71},{"key":"24 Q4","value":45.28},{"key":"25 Q1","value":9.21}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

Devices (AMD) faces a mixed demand environment reflected in its financial performance, with Q4 2022 Embedded segment revenues declining 13% year-over-year to $923 million, indicating sluggish recovery across key markets. Additionally, AMD's Gaming segment experienced a significant revenue drop of 59% year-over-year, totaling $563 million, primarily due to reduced semi-custom sales as major clients like Microsoft and Sony concentrated on depleting channel inventories. Furthermore, projections for flattish AI GPU revenue in the first half of 2025, estimated at approximately $1.75-$1.80 billion per quarter, coupled with concerns regarding execution on new product launches, suggest potential revenue stagnation and underscore a negative outlook for the company’s financial trajectory."],"bullsSay":["Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) anticipates a strengthened demand environment across its business segments in 2025, forecasting robust growth particularly in the Data Center and Client segments, with notable quarterly sales increases of 12% in Q4 driven by substantial gains in its Client, Data Center, and Gaming segments. The fourth quarter concluded with a significantly stronger performance than internally projected, bolstered by a healthy market supply/demand balance and record sell-through of desktop and mobile units. Additionally, AMD achieved $14 billion in design wins for 2024, reflecting over a 25% year-over-year increase, while also benefiting from burgeoning public cloud demand, evidenced by a 27% rise in EPYC instances, positioning the company favorably for ongoing market share growth."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Computing and Graphics","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":2250},{"key":"21 Q3","value":2398},{"key":"21 Q4","value":2584}]},{"title":"Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":1600},{"key":"21 Q3","value":1915},{"key":"21 Q4","value":2242}]},{"title":"Data Center","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q1","value":1293},{"key":"22 Q2","value":1486},{"key":"22 Q3","value":1609},{"key":"22 Q4","value":1655},{"key":"23 Q1","value":1295},{"key":"23 Q2","value":1321},{"key":"23 Q3","value":1598},{"key":"23 Q4","value":2282},{"key":"24 Q1","value":2337},{"key":"24 Q2","value":2834},{"key":"24 Q3","value":3549},{"key":"24 Q4","value":3859},{"key":"25 Q1","value":3674}]},{"title":"Client","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q1","value":2124},{"key":"22 Q2","value":2152},{"key":"22 Q3","value":1022},{"key":"22 Q4","value":903},{"key":"23 Q1","value":739},{"key":"23 Q2","value":998},{"key":"23 Q3","value":1453},{"key":"23 Q4","value":1461},{"key":"24 Q1","value":1368},{"key":"24 Q2","value":1492},{"key":"24 Q3","value":1881},{"key":"24 Q4","value":2313},{"key":"25 Q1","value":2294}]},{"title":"Gaming","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q1","value":1875},{"key":"22 Q2","value":1655},{"key":"22 Q3","value":1631},{"key":"22 Q4","value":1644},{"key":"23 Q1","value":1757},{"key":"23 Q2","value":1581},{"key":"23 Q3","value":1506},{"key":"23 Q4","value":1368},{"key":"24 Q1","value":922},{"key":"24 Q2","value":648},{"key":"24 Q3","value":462},{"key":"24 Q4","value":563},{"key":"25 Q1","value":647}]},{"title":"Embedded","dataPoints":[{"key":"22 Q1","value":595},{"key":"22 Q2","value":1257},{"key":"22 Q3","value":1303},{"key":"22 Q4","value":1397},{"key":"23 Q1","value":1562},{"key":"23 Q2","value":1459},{"key":"23 Q3","value":1243},{"key":"23 Q4","value":1057},{"key":"24 Q1","value":846},{"key":"24 Q2","value":861},{"key":"24 Q3","value":927},{"key":"24 Q4","value":923},{"key":"25 Q1","value":823}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":47.53},{"key":"21 Q3","value":48.36},{"key":"21 Q4","value":50.26},{"key":"22 Q1","value":47.86},{"key":"22 Q2","value":46.22},{"key":"22 Q3","value":42.3},{"key":"22 Q4","value":42.91},{"key":"23 Q1","value":44.06},{"key":"23 Q2","value":45.58},{"key":"23 Q3","value":47.36},{"key":"23 Q4","value":47.19},{"key":"24 Q1","value":46.77},{"key":"24 Q2","value":49.08},{"key":"24 Q3","value":50.13},{"key":"24 Q4","value":50.69},{"key":"25 Q1","value":50.22}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":21.58},{"key":"21 Q3","value":21.98},{"key":"21 Q4","value":25.01},{"key":"22 Q1","value":16.15},{"key":"22 Q2","value":8.03},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-1.16},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-2.67},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-2.71},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-0.38},{"key":"23 Q3","value":3.86},{"key":"23 Q4","value":5.54},{"key":"24 Q1","value":0.65},{"key":"24 Q2","value":4.61},{"key":"24 Q3","value":10.61},{"key":"24 Q4","value":11.37},{"key":"25 Q1","value":10.83}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":18.44},{"key":"21 Q3","value":21.4},{"key":"21 Q4","value":20.18},{"key":"22 Q1","value":13.35},{"key":"22 Q2","value":6.82},{"key":"22 Q3","value":1.18},{"key":"22 Q4","value":0.37},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-2.6},{"key":"23 Q2","value":0.5},{"key":"23 Q3","value":5.15},{"key":"23 Q4","value":10.81},{"key":"24 Q1","value":2.24},{"key":"24 Q2","value":4.54},{"key":"24 Q3","value":11.3},{"key":"24 Q4","value":6.29},{"key":"25 Q1","value":9.53}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

It is the world's second-largest bank by market capitalization and the third largest bank in the U.S. by total assets. In July 2015, Wells Fargo became the world's largest bank by market capitalization, edging past ICBC, before slipping behind JPMorgan Chase in September 2016, in the wake of a scandal involving the creation of over 2 million fake bank accounts by Wells Fargo employees. Wells Fargo surpassed Citigroup Inc. to become the third-largest U.S. bank by assets at the end of 2015 but fell behind Bank of America to third in bank deposits in 2017. Wells Fargo remains the second-largest bank in home mortgage servicing and debit cards.

Entertainment Holdings Inc. faces a negative outlook primarily due to a prolonged economic downturn that could significantly decrease consumer spending on movie attendance, thereby jeopardizing the company's financial condition. Additionally, depressed margins and findings from the Macquarie Quant Alpha model, which indicate that AMC is among the bottom 5% of companies assessed, highlight the stock's overpriced status compared to peers. Furthermore, substantial lease and debt obligations, along with competition affecting revenues from National CineMedia and the rise of alternative film delivery methods, pose additional risks to the company's future profitability."],"bullsSay":["AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is projected to experience significant financial growth, with EBITDA margins anticipated to rise from approximately 7% in 2024 to 13% by 2026, reflecting robust operational improvements. The company reported a notable 20% year-over-year increase in attendance, hitting a post-pandemic fourth quarter record, driven by peak patronage during Thanksgiving. Furthermore, forward guidance indicates substantial growth in the domestic box office, expecting an increase between $500 million and $1 billion in 2025, underpinned by a stronger film lineup and

growth expectations have been significantly dampened due to broader economic pressures, resulting in a projected low-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth for FY25, which reflects weakened consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, a disappointing iPhone 16 cycle has been exacerbated by intense competition and a deceleration in services growth, leading to lowered shipment projections for the iPhone in FY25 and FY26. Lastly, heightened negative sentiment surrounding Apple has been fueled by delays in advanced features like Siri, concerns over China tariffs, and an overall jittery tech stock environment, suggesting a challenging outlook for the company."],"bullsSay":["Apple exhibits a strong financial outlook driven by robust iPhone sales, with projections indicating the company will sell approximately 225 million to 230 million units in FY25, followed by growth towards 245 million to 250 million units in FY26. The firm anticipates a significant uptick in revenue from iPhones, surpassing 20% year-over-year growth, spurred by strong consumer demand and an upgrade cycle with the iPhone 16. Coupled with consistent double-digit growth in services, stable gross margins, and the introduction of new products, Apple's earnings could reach $8.20 in CY26 and exceed $9 by

indicates that NVIDIA has experienced a notable decline in its performance indicators, with its earnings beat shrinking from double-digit percentages to just 3% in the most recent quarter, and its

Additionally, there are concerning trends in specific revenue lines such as gaming and networking, with significant drops in growth rates, highlighted by a reduction from 264% to 78% year-over-year. Furthermore, the company faces various risks that could further dampen its financial outlook, including slow AI adoption, weakened demand in gaming markets, rising competition, and challenges in product execution, all of which could adversely impact revenue growth."],"bullsSay":["Nvidia's financial outlook is bolstered by a significant increase in compute revenue, which reached $32.556 billion, reflecting an 18% quarter-over-quarter growth and a remarkable 116% year-over-year growth, driven by expanding demand in data centers and AI applications. The company's robust balance sheet includes cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities amounting to $43.2 billion, a substantial increase from $26.0 billion a year ago, indicating strong liquidity and financial health. Additionally, notable growth across various sectors is highlighted by a 300% year-over-year increase in consumer internet revenue and a 200% increase in enterprise revenue, underscoring Nvidia's

Inc. has experienced a substantial decline in its stock price, down approximately 28% year-to-date, which significantly underperforms compared to the broader market indices within the Aerospace \u0026

The company faces multiple challenges, including high execution risks associated with its planned acquisition of Mynaric, which has been plagued by production issues impacting program timelines and causing delays for critical contracts such as the SDA Tranche 1 program. Additional financial concerns stem from an expected EBITDA loss guidance of ($27M)-($29M), as well as a reliance on government contracts in an environment marked by inconsistent demand and competitive pressures within the space industry."],"bullsSay":["Rocket Lab USA Inc. has demonstrated a robust growth trajectory, with FY24 revenue estimates increased to approximately $431 million, reflecting a strong contribution from Space Systems and an elevated average selling price for Electron launches. Projections for FY26 and FY27 have also been revised upwards to about $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, driven by the expected incorporation of Neutron launches into the company’s operational model.

highlights several fundamental concerns regarding Netflix's financial outlook. Firstly, there are expectations that Netflix’s revenue growth in Q1 2025 may fall short at 11%, which is modestly below full-year guidance, indicating potential challenges in subscriber growth and revenue generation. Additionally, factors such as inflated valuations, heightened competition, and potential difficulties in content selection and retention could negatively impact Netflix's profitability and long-term cash flow projections."],"bullsSay":["Netflix's stock outlook remains positive due to its substantial growth in subscribers, adding 18.9 million net subscribers in the fourth quarter, which reflects the success of its content strategy and measures to combat account sharing. The company reported a revenue increase of 19% in constant currency to $10.25 billion, alongside a remarkable 52% year-over-year jump in operating profit to $2.27 billion, resulting in a significant rise in operating margin. Projections for 2025 indicate continued revenue growth of 14% to approximately $44.4 billion, with operating profit expected to reach $13.2 billion, further supported by controlled content costs and
