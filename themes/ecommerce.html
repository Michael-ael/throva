For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile. You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan. Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.

excerpts indicate a negative outlook for Nike's stock, primarily driven by a forecasted decline in revenue trends, with expectations of low-double-digit (LDD) declines in reported terms and worse performance in constant foreign exchange (FX) terms. The company is also anticipating a significant drop in gross margins, projected to contract by 300-350 basis points as they work through excess inventory, exacerbating pressures on earnings per share (EPS). With additional margin deleverage leading to a potential EPS of approximately $1.75, Nike is facing challenges in maintaining profitability amid a backdrop of modest sales and margin erosion anticipated for fiscal year 2026."],"bullsSay":["Nike's positive outlook is supported by a significant improvement in gross margins, which exceeded initial guidance by 120 basis points year-over-year, indicating strong operational efficiency. The company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategy, coupled with market share gains and supply chain innovations, enhances its competitive position in a growing global activewear market. Additionally, an increase in consumer interest for key product assortments and a favorable macro environment suggests potential for renewed growth in sales, margins, and earnings per share in the coming quarters."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue by

Additionally, the robust international travel demand post-pandemic positions Expedia favorably for continued growth, with Vrbo receiving an influx of inventory that bolsters its competitive edge against market leaders."],"charts":[{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Expedia Group (excluding trivago)","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":2020},{"key":"21 Q3","value":2841},{"key":"21 Q4","value":2211},{"key":"22 Q1","value":2172},{"key":"22 Q2","value":3070},{"key":"22 Q3","value":3495},{"key":"22 Q4","value":2550}]},{"title":"Trivago","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":115},{"key":"21 Q3","value":163},{"key":"21 Q4","value":99},{"key":"22 Q1","value":116},{"key":"22 Q2","value":154},{"key":"22 Q3","value":185},{"key":"22 Q4","value":106}]},{"title":"Intercompany eliminations","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":-24},{"key":"21 Q3","value":-42},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-31},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-39},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-43},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-61},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-38}]},{"title":"B2C","dataPoints":[{"key":"23 Q1","value":1921},{"key":"23 Q2","value":2415},{"key":"23 Q3","value":2819},{"key":"23 Q4","value":1958},{"key":"24 Q1","value":1986},{"key":"24 Q2","value":2432},{"key":"24 Q3","value":2780},{"key":"24 Q4","value":2076},{"key":"25 Q1","value":1956}]},{"title":"B2B","dataPoints":[{"key":"23 Q1","value":668},{"key":"23 Q2","value":861},{"key":"23 Q3","value":995},{"key":"23 Q4","value":864},{"key":"24 Q1","value":833},{"key":"24 Q2","value":1049},{"key":"24 Q3","value":1178},{"key":"24 Q4","value":1042},{"key":"25 Q1","value":947}]},{"title":"trivago (third-party revenue)","dataPoints":[{"key":"23 Q1","value":76},{"key":"23 Q2","value":82},{"key":"23 Q3","value":115},{"key":"23 Q4","value":65},{"key":"24 Q1","value":70},{"key":"24 Q2","value":77},{"key":"24 Q3","value":102},{"key":"24 Q4","value":66},{"key":"25 Q1","value":85}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":82.28},{"key":"21 Q3","value":85.07},{"key":"21 Q4","value":82.66},{"key":"22 Q1","value":83.5},{"key":"22 Q2","value":86.82},{"key":"22 Q3","value":87.42},{"key":"22 Q4","value":84.26},{"key":"23 Q1","value":84.46},{"key":"23 Q2","value":87.87},{"key":"23 Q3","value":89.51},{"key":"23 Q4","value":88.22},{"key":"24 Q1","value":87.6},{"key":"24 Q2","value":89.82},{"key":"24 Q3","value":90.44},{"key":"24 Q4","value":89.47},{"key":"25 Q1","value":88.05}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":-6.26},{"key":"21 Q3","value":17.69},{"key":"21 Q4","value":7.15},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-6.01},{"key":"22 Q2","value":10.84},{"key":"22 Q3","value":20.64},{"key":"22 Q4","value":4.88},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-4.55},{"key":"23 Q2","value":13.19},{"key":"23 Q3","value":15.44},{"key":"23 Q4","value":3.6},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-3.81},{"key":"24 Q2","value":12.67},{"key":"24 Q3","value":18.76},{"key":"24 Q4","value":6.78},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-2.35}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":-8.15},{"key":"21 Q3","value":12.69},{"key":"21 Q4","value":16.93},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-5.43},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-5.82},{"key":"22 Q3","value":13.31},{"key":"22 Q4","value":6.76},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-5.45},{"key":"23 Q2","value":11.46},{"key":"23 Q3","value":10.81},{"key":"23 Q4","value":4.57},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-4.68},{"key":"24 Q2","value":10.84},{"key":"24 Q3","value":16.84},{"key":"24 Q4","value":9.39},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-6.7}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

experiencing significant challenges, with a notable decline in Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) attributed to increased advertising expenditures that surpassed earlier projections. The company is also grappling with a 35% year-over-year decrease in Effective Buyer's Contribution (EBC), with expectations for continued declines into 2025, as evidenced by guidance predicting net revenue flat to down for the first quarter of 2025. Additionally, ongoing risks include increasing competition, potential mismanagement of employee headcount, challenges in scaling logistics and IT, and overall difficulty in acquiring and retaining customers efficiently, all of which may hamper future growth and profitability."],"bullsSay":["Wayfair has exhibited positive financial momentum with a sequential increase in EBITDA margin for three consecutive quarters, improving by 224 basis points, alongside a reported 1.1% growth in U.S. net sales. The company's focus on driving customer and order acquisition through elevated advertising spend, now at 13.7% of sales, suggests a strategic investment in market presence that may enhance revenue streams moving forward. Additionally, the trends in adjusted EBITDA growth expectations, supported by operational expense savings and improved technology initiatives, position Wayfair favorably for continued growth into 2025 and beyond."],"charts":[{"title":"Active Customers","description":null,"chartType":"VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"NUMBER","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Active Customers","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":31.067},{"key":"21 Q3","value":29.213},{"key":"21 Q4","value":27.3},{"key":"22 Q1","value":25.4},{"key":"22 Q2","value":23.6},{"key":"22 Q3","value":22.6},{"key":"22 Q4","value":22.1},{"key":"23 Q1","value":21.7},{"key":"23 Q2","value":21.8},{"key":"23 Q3","value":22.3},{"key":"23 Q4","value":22.4},{"key":"24 Q1","value":22.3},{"key":"24 Q2","value":22},{"key":"24 Q3","value":21.7},{"key":"24 Q4","value":21.4},{"key":"25 Q1","value":21.1}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":29.24},{"key":"21 Q3","value":28.28},{"key":"21 Q4","value":27.09},{"key":"22 Q1","value":26.82},{"key":"22 Q2","value":27.28},{"key":"22 Q3","value":29.01},{"key":"22 Q4","value":28.79},{"key":"23 Q1","value":29.59},{"key":"23 Q2","value":31.06},{"key":"23 Q3","value":31.14},{"key":"23 Q4","value":30.31},{"key":"24 Q1","value":30.01},{"key":"24 Q2","value":30.18},{"key":"24 Q3","value":30.27},{"key":"24 Q4","value":30.15},{"key":"25 Q1","value":30.65}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":3.76},{"key":"21 Q3","value":-2.24},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-6.03},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-10.36},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-11.33},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-13.1},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-10.65},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-12.51},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-4.48},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-5.17},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-5.53},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-8.62},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-1.13},{"key":"24 Q3","value":-2.57},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-3.75},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-4.47}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":3.38},{"key":"21 Q3","value":-2.5},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-6.22},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-10.66},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-11.52},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-9.97},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-11.32},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-12.8},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-1.46},{"key":"23 Q3","value":-5.54},{"key":"23 Q4","value":-5.59},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-9.09},{"key":"24 Q2","value":-1.35},{"key":"24 Q3","value":-2.57},{"key":"24 Q4","value":-4.11},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-4.14}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

Additionally, Shopify's operational efficiency is reflected in a modest increase in non-GAAP operating expenses, which rose only 7% quarter-over-quarter to 27% of revenue, alongside a rise in the take rate to 2.27%, signaling a solid foundation for future profitability."],"charts":[{"title":"GMV","description":null,"chartType":"VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"GMV","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":42200},{"key":"21 Q3","value":41800},{"key":"21 Q4","value":54100},{"key":"22 Q1","value":43200},{"key":"22 Q2","value":46900},{"key":"22 Q3","value":46200},{"key":"22 Q4","value":61000},{"key":"23 Q1","value":49568},{"key":"23 Q2","value":55012},{"key":"23 Q3","value":56205},{"key":"23 Q4","value":75125},{"key":"24 Q1","value":60855},{"key":"24 Q2","value":67245},{"key":"24 Q3","value":69715},{"key":"24 Q4","value":94460},{"key":"25 Q1","value":74750}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Revenue Segments","description":"Revenue segments as reported by the company.","chartType":"STACKED_VERTICAL_BARS","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"MONEY","valueMultiplier":1000000,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":"USD","currencySymbol":"$","series":[{"title":"Subscription solutions","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":334.237},{"key":"21 Q3","value":336.208},{"key":"21 Q4","value":351.208},{"key":"22 Q1","value":344.761},{"key":"22 Q2","value":366.443},{"key":"22 Q3","value":376.301},{"key":"22 Q4","value":400.254},{"key":"23 Q1","value":382},{"key":"23 Q2","value":444},{"key":"23 Q3","value":486},{"key":"23 Q4","value":525},{"key":"24 Q1","value":511},{"key":"24 Q2","value":563},{"key":"24 Q3","value":610},{"key":"24 Q4","value":666},{"key":"25 Q1","value":620}]},{"title":"Merchant solutions","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":785.208},{"key":"21 Q3","value":787.532},{"key":"21 Q4","value":1028.816},{"key":"22 Q1","value":858.862},{"key":"22 Q2","value":928.62},{"key":"22 Q3","value":989.899},{"key":"22 Q4","value":1334.724},{"key":"23 Q1","value":1126},{"key":"23 Q2","value":1250},{"key":"23 Q3","value":1228},{"key":"23 Q4","value":1619},{"key":"24 Q1","value":1350},{"key":"24 Q2","value":1482},{"key":"24 Q3","value":1552},{"key":"24 Q4","value":2146},{"key":"25 Q1","value":1740}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Margins","description":"Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income as a percentage of Revenue","chartType":"AREA","keyType":"STRING","valueType":"PERCENT","valueMultiplier":1,"valueFormat":null,"isoCurrency":null,"currencySymbol":null,"series":[{"title":"Gross Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":55.46},{"key":"21 Q3","value":54.18},{"key":"21 Q4","value":50.19},{"key":"22 Q1","value":52.97},{"key":"22 Q2","value":50.62},{"key":"22 Q3","value":48.47},{"key":"22 Q4","value":46.02},{"key":"23 Q1","value":47.54},{"key":"23 Q2","value":49.29},{"key":"23 Q3","value":52.56},{"key":"23 Q4","value":49.53},{"key":"24 Q1","value":51.42},{"key":"24 Q2","value":51.1},{"key":"24 Q3","value":51.71},{"key":"24 Q4","value":48.07},{"key":"25 Q1","value":49.53}]},{"title":"Operating Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":12.45},{"key":"21 Q3","value":-0.37},{"key":"21 Q4","value":1.04},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-8.15},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-14.69},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-25.28},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-10.88},{"key":"23 Q1","value":-12.8},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-96.58},{"key":"23 Q3","value":7.11},{"key":"23 Q4","value":13.47},{"key":"24 Q1","value":4.62},{"key":"24 Q2","value":11.78},{"key":"24 Q3","value":13.08},{"key":"24 Q4","value":16.53},{"key":"25 Q1","value":8.6}]},{"title":"Profit Margin","dataPoints":[{"key":"21 Q2","value":78.52},{"key":"21 Q3","value":102.19},{"key":"21 Q4","value":-26.91},{"key":"22 Q1","value":-122.5},{"key":"22 Q2","value":-92.97},{"key":"22 Q3","value":-11.6},{"key":"22 Q4","value":-35.95},{"key":"23 Q1","value":4.5},{"key":"23 Q2","value":-77.4},{"key":"23 Q3","value":41.89},{"key":"23 Q4","value":30.64},{"key":"24 Q1","value":-14.67},{"key":"24 Q2","value":8.36},{"key":"24 Q3","value":38.29},{"key":"24 Q4","value":45.98},{"key":"25 Q1","value":-28.9}]}],"overlayChart":null},{"title":"Operating Expenses","description":"An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations.

FY25 revenue for Amazon.com has been revised downward to $699.4 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of only 10%, which is 1% less than previous estimates. In addition, ongoing stagnation in product sales, which have been trapped between $61 billion and $67 billion outside of the traditionally strong fourth quarter since the beginning of 2021, raises concerns about the overall growth trajectory. Furthermore, the company's decision to decrease the useful life of certain servers, anticipated to reduce operating income by approximately $700 million, suggests potential operational inefficiencies that could further impact profitability amidst broader economic uncertainties."],"bullsSay":["Amazon.com demonstrates a strong financial outlook driven by notable growth in key segments.
