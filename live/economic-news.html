I'm your host Kinsey Grant and today's show is brought to you by Tema ETFs and joining us as today's guest is Chris Seminec. He's an investor partner at Tema ETFs, and they're an issuer focused on bottom-up investing in unique structural themes like the one that I'm sure we will talk about today in this conversation. The RSHO ETF, that's the ticker R-S-H-O, excuse me, is one that we're gonna talk a lot about today because we are talking about reshoring, which is a really interesting practice that is certainly derived from a lot of macroeconomic and geopolitical realities that we're facing today and is something that is certainly an interesting force in the economy and in the investing world. So Chris, welcome to the Public Podcast. I'm excited to talk about this with you today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChris Semenuk: \u003c/strong\u003eHi, Kinsey. Thanks for having me on.\\\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course, of course. So I want to start here with some big-picture stuff. When we think about bringing more jobs to the United States or bolstering the economy, the domestic economy, it seems like a relatively simple thing to do in theory. But you and I both know that in practice, it's likely much more complicated than just bringing more jobs here and bolstering the economy. Especially in the light of the last few years, we had what I think many of us would kind of consider a supply chain breakdown in 2020, shortly after the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. We've been seeing this transition from more international supply chains to more domestic ones. But I would love to hear a little bit in the big picture about how you would define this reality, this part of the economy, the global economy that might be focused on this practice of reshoring. Tell me a little bit about what reshoring is and how we see those forces at play right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. So reshoring, when you read about it in the newspapers, I think can be defined most simply as just companies that are locating or bringing production from overseas back to the shores of the United States. But I think it's really important for investors to step back for a minute because what that is, is the result of, you know, reshoring is a result of a process that has started a few years ago, a few years back, which is essentially that companies are number one unwinding a lot of the unintended exposures that resulted from essentially 20 or 30 years of globalization. What I mean by these sort of exposures are when they located production from shores of the US to overseas to take advantage of low-cost labor, they ended up incurring that resulted from essentially 20 or 30 years of globalization. And what I mean by these sort of exposures are, when they located production from shores of the US to overseas to take advantage of low-cost labor, they ended up incurring or ended up getting exposed to certain vulnerabilities and certain exposures by having their production located or ended up getting exposed to certain vulnerabilities and certain exposures by having their production located five, six thousand miles away. So reshoring is, I think, a response or, as I said, an unwinding of those vulnerabilities or unintended consequences of globalization. Now there are two other trends going on at the same time, and one of them is that during this time of globalization, which really started back during 2000, which was when China entered WTO. Over that 20 years of globalization, that search for low-cost labor, I think companies in the US neglected their manufacturing base here in the US. And I think we're now finding out that companies are aware of that primarily because of what happened during the pandemic and also what happened as it relates to a number of the global to a number of the global conflicts and wars that have taken place in recent years. So reshoring is a trend that's been in place, I think, for years, even though a lot of people assume it was a response to the pandemic or to global conflict. Now there's a third underlying trend and conflicts and wars that have taken place in recent years. So reshoring is a trend that's been in place, I think, for years, even though a lot of people assume it was a response to the pandemic or to global conflict. Now there's a third underlying trend, and that is that the US government is now spending or is now writing a check that represents the largest value in terms of industrial policy in history. And what the government is trying to do is, in my mind, essentially crowd in private investment here in the U.S. to essentially address that neglected industrial manufacturing infrastructure that was sort of left behind over the last 20 years as U.S. corporates looked outside the shores of the U.S. for production is in my mind essentially crowd in private investment here in the US to essentially address that neglected industrial manufacturing structure that was sort of left behind over the last 20 years as US corporates looked outside of the shores of the US for production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that certainly makes a lot of sense, and I appreciate the context especially to illustrate that this is not something that is just a post-2020 reality, right? That reshoring and globalization been forces that have been at play for quite some time. Now, before we get into some of those, the kind of next phase of what comes after this reshoring trend here, I would love to talk a little bit about the vulnerabilities of globalization that you mentioned. What might some of those vulnerabilities be? And in what case and at what point might those vulnerabilities be encourage a company to engage in some reshoring to bring production or to bring industry back to the United States? Tell me a little bit about how that plays out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think a lot of investors conflate reshoring as a company's defensive move as it relates to events that have essentially highlighted the vulnerabilities and exposures that have resulted from globalization. So there are indeed cases where companies or manufacturers are moving production or parts of production back to the US as a sort of defensive measure. That said, though, there are also examples of companies that are taking an offensive approach to reshoring. And so it's not just manufacturing. It can be a retailer, for example, that wants to locate some of its production here in the US. And they see it as an offensive measure, meaning you're closer to your customers, your design is closer to your manufacturing. And when those two factors are in place, you can have quicker product cycles, but also more product cycles. And ultimately that just results in more growth. So reshoring is not only defensive, but it's also an offensive move for companies. But broadly speaking, we're taking a very active approach to the theme. And I think that's really important for investors to keep in mind. Reshoring is not a one size fits all positive on every company that does it. And as I said, it's both defensive and offensive. Not only that, but reshoring is not only the company, the reshoring opportunity is not only companies that are moving manufacturing, but it's companies that are supplying to those people, to those companies and companies that are support services to those companies as well. And I think it's really in those areas, not, you know, it's not just about the caterpillars or the large manufacturers that you read about in the headlines of the newspapers every day it's actually about the more smaller medium-cap businesses that are kind of being pulled along with those manufacturers who are going to have to set up supply chains, support services here in the US that they didn't have before, and that's going to create underlying demand for businesses that I think a lot of people don't necessarily think about, and it's why we started the fund because we think those are opportunities we want to get in that are kind of being pulled along with those manufacturers who are going to have to set up supply chains, support services here in the US that he didn't have before. And that's gonna create underlying demand for businesses that I think a lot of people don't necessarily think about. And it's why we started the fund because we think those are opportunities we wanna give.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's also the orders of magnitude of like impact that they have on all sorts of other companies and businesses and even investing themes as well. Now, one thing that I do want to get your perspective on before we dig in more to the ETF, because I am interested to hear more about how that works and you know what you're doing over there. One thing is this idea of the balancing act that companies are always continuously having to engage in. When we're talking about reshoring specifically or globalization, even more broadly,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eWe're talking about corporations that have to think about the timeline of their product cycles. They also have to think about labor costs. They also have to think about economic headwinds and all sorts of impacts in the economy, globally speaking. But they also do have to consider geopolitical tensions. You mentioned that there are companies that are engaging in reshoring as both offense and defense. But I am curious about how geopolitical tensions, especially with China, might impact American companies making a decision to engage in restoring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is something that has always kind of been heating up, it's always what people use those two words to describe tensions between the United States and China. But we saw that China is taking all their pandas back from the rest of the world. They were seeing some headlines now. So I'm curious to hear your perspective on how that plays into this larger conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so again, I think a lot of investors and people that sort of watch this space sort of immediately link this as a kind of US versus China issue. As I said, it's not really that. It's really an unwinding of some unintended negative consequences of globalization. Look, it took 20 years for us to kind of get into this situation. It'll take us decades to kind of unwind some of these unwanted practices. You're right. I mean, at the moment, or at least if you look back since China entered WTO, it's been pretty much a bipolar manufacturing world. We've had the US on one side and we've had China on the other. And I think what we're witnessing now is in some ways, a kind of effort by both sides to sort of reduce this sort of economic interdependence on one another. And I think Jake Sullivan, who has been very vocal as part of the current administration, now is in some ways. It's interesting that the administration puts the National Security Advisor in front of the public when talking about American manufacturing and his whole sort of focus is initially on critical areas or areas of say national security. So that's why the first wave of reshoring focused on EV batteries, on semiconductors, on pharmaceuticals. As I said, from an investment opportunity standpoint, there are opportunities there. Those companies that make those products are kind of making the reshoring journey. But beyond that, as I said, there's a whole world of the kind of picks and shovels, if you will, that people will need to use. And I think those picks and shovels will be enormous investment opportunities that I think, again, can only be uncovered using an active process. But as I said, we're moving from this sort of bipolar manufacturing world to a multipolar world. And I think that multipolar world involves not only sort of Mexico, but it involves companies moving out of China into and around the regions of China, India, Mexico, Bangladesh. But broadly speaking, you know, the fund is focused on businesses that are relocating manufacturing back to the US. We do own some foreign companies. In the cases there are companies like ABB, the Swiss company that makes a lot of electrical utility equipment. They have specifically said that they want to take advantage of the spending that the US government is putting in place in these incentives. So they are actually, in terms of their total capital investment, increasing it the most in the US in terms of their manufacturing footprint. f their total capital investment increasing at the most in the US in terms of manufacturing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eMakes sense, yeah. I think within the idea of this as an investment opportunity, which is something we've kind of touched on a little bit here, I would love to hear more about the $RSHO ETF. You mentioned that it's investing in companies that are engaging in reshoring. But tell me a little bit about the premise beyond that and how it might fit into investors' portfolios, especially those who might be listening today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so investors should see the American Reshoring Fund as, well, what it is, is about 31 companies. And the common thread that runs through every one of these companies is that they are, as we define, high quality. So high quality for us means business that generates net-free cash flow throughout the business cycle and is able to use that free cash flow and reinvest it at competitive rates of return. And then also what they don't use, pay it back to shareholders who buybacks and dividends. So if you strip away the reshoring theme of the fund, what an investor is essentially left with is, as I said, a collection of very high quality cashflow generating businesses. And when you layer on the reshoring theme, these businesses are essentially getting a tailwind of demand that we think will last at least, as I said, it took more than a couple of decades for us to kind of get into this predicament where we have vulnerable supply chains, it'll take at least a couple of decades to get out. And as a result, we think this is a very durable investment theme that we think will play out over years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. And for investors who are listening to this, can you explain the relevance of this idea of durability in a portfolio, especially for people who are interested in buying and holding?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so these, as I said, these are businesses that have shown a propensity to create shareholder value historically. So I think it's really important for investors when they think about the theme, as I said, it fits into a core equity strategy. These are just simply very high quality, in some cases, manufacturing businesses, in some cases, service companies that I think an investor would look at anyway. And as I said, what we've tried to do is say, okay, we've got this collection of high quality businesses that generate free cash, that generate competitive ROIC. Where are we in this portfolio in terms of businesses that intersect with this secular tailwind of demand that, as I said, I think will last years in the making? So, you know, again, the American manufacturing footprint used to be regarded as sort of the leader in the world. you know, back in the sort of 70s. And, you know, we relinquished that during the period of globalization. But I think the administration, the government, is in support of kind of rebuilding the American infrastructure. They're putting money behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eCompanies recognize the benefits of it. And the durability of the trend, I think, will be at least a couple of decades in the making. Okay. And how has this reinvestment in American manufacturing panned out? I mean, obviously this idea of, this is a long-term conversation, it's years in the making, but so far, how's it been?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so the fund launched in May and performance has been excellent. I think what we're seeing is that the businesses in the portfolio, as I said, are very high quality in nature in terms of their ability to generate free cash and invest at a high ROIC. Now, what's happened is that post the pandemic, when we've had customers and customers of the manufacturing complex. ordering two and three times what they thought they would get because we had supply chain shortages. A lot of the companies that we own in the portfolio that are manufacturing related didn't hire headcount to address that. So, as I said, as we kind of move forward going through this economic uncertain period that we're moving into with high interest rates and threat of recession, all of the companies in the portfolio are still running very lean because they didn't over hire back in sort of 21 as we exited the pandemic. So I think as and when this sort of recovery starts to pick up again in 2024, the businesses in the fund that we're invested in, I think, stand to actually over earn going forward as their revenues start to regrow again. And keep in mind that at the moment, many of the companies in the portfolio right now have backlogs that are almost double and triple what they were before they went into the pandemic. And these backlogs are still, you know, I think stand to actually over earn going forward as their revenues start to regrow again. And they keep it double and triple what they were before they went into the pandemic. And these backlogs are still, you know, too excellent what they were and are taking some time to work off. So the fact is, even if we go into a recession, these backlogs may allow these companies to continue to grow straight through a recession and then come out the air of the sun and continue growing as the economy eventually improves. So the fact is, even if we go into a recession, these backlogs may allow these companies to continue to grow straight through a recession and then come out the other side and continue with growing as the economy eventually improves again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eMakes sense to me.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Hello everybody and welcome to the public podcast. I'm your host, Ann Berry, and today's show is brought to you by iShares. We are joined by Nick Morales, who focuses on investment insights across asset classes, both retail and institutional clients are those that he works with. And he's there in iShares investment strategy team. Also joining us today, we have Faye Witherall, who delivers thought leadership on the broad market and economic outlook also at iShares. Nick and Faye, welcome. to the public podcast. It's great to have you both on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Morales:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you so much, Ann. Pleasure to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's start with some research, Faye and Nick, that you and your team have been releasing to the market late last month. iShares released the 2023 mid-year outlook, the half-time report, and it mentions that for the first half of 2023 it's been quote characterized by opposing narratives. So I'm excited to jump right in and get to the heart of what exactly does that mean? What are those two opposing narratives that you have been focused on?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so what we've really been focused on, and I think the market at large has too, is this idea of whether or not we're actually going to be in a recession at this moment or whether or not we're going to have this soft landing. So that's when you hear on all the headlines and all the talk radio shows and the like, when we hear soft versus hard landing, it's whether or not we're in a recession or not. So our contention is whether or not we're in a recession is really going to come down to semantics at the end of the day. really matters for the time being is that the Federal Reserve is going to keep holding rates a bit higher for a bit longer. And this is because the battle against inflation isn't really over quite yet. Though we did get a really good inflationary disinflationary print last week on Wednesday, where it came over to point 2% month over month, we like to look at that month-over-month number, still doesn't mean we're quite out of the woods yet. So we think the Federal Reserve will hold rates where they're at, maybe hike another time. but for the most part, they're gonna hold them there until probably March of 2024. So in that sort of context, it means that we have a preference for fixed income at the moment. We think that the front end of the curve looks really attractive right now. So there's some really good opportunities for investors overall, but when it comes to the underlying economic backdrop, the hard and soft landing, both of those camps are still definitely competing and there is varied data. So we're a bit uncertain of where that kind works itself out. But in the time being, there's some great opportunities in fixed income that we can talk more about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB:\u003c/strong\u003e So, Faye and Nick, that you've brought up a lot there, let's just unpack some of the terminology. Let's talk about what you mean by a soft landing. It's one of those terms that's being bandied around a lot because it seems to be increasingly likely, but no one's really defining it. So, Faye or Nick, help us understand exactly what you mean by that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFaye Witherall:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so this has been a very topical term, as you mentioned. We've heard this a lot over the past few months. So a soft landing is the goal of a central bank when it lowers inflation to an acceptable rate without leading to a severe economic downturn or a large increase in unemployment. So we can just back up for some context. The Federal Reserve's delivered 10 consecutive interest rate hikes over the last 15 months, paused only in June in this attempt to really tame surging inflation. So typically, when interest rates rise, we see a reduction in economic activity, and borrowing costs increase. So in essence, the Fed is maneuvering the plane. It's using monetary policy to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eTrying to touch the runway without any breaks or hiccups. That's your soft landing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB\u003c/strong\u003e: So, and it just is sort of really unpacked that using some numbers. One definition of a recession is one of several, and it's not the only one. It's not the only factor that is technically two consecutive quarters of GDP decline. Am I hearing that soft landing can mean no growth or very slow growth, but certainly not decline. So again, just in terms of numbers, soft landing is 0% growth or more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, the way I would go and think about it there is that we have what we call the real growth of the United States. That's GDP growth. It's our potential at the end of the day, which is around that 2% number. We know that we're going to be coming in below that. And whether or not you're in a recession is whether you come in below that and also dip below that 0%. So you're contracting on a GDP basis. And I think no matter what, we're gonna be below that 2% number, kind of like our potential as an economy, but whether or not we dip into that negative territory, we'll see. And right now, what we're really seeing in the market is kind of these pockets in which we are seeing that negative growth, but then there's other pockets that are really strong. So, for instance, in manufacturing right now, we're definitely looking at recessionary territory. Industrial production is really low, and capex spend is really low. But then you look towards the US consumer. You have real income rising. You have low unemployment. So that part of the economy, which to be fair, represents around 70% of US GDP, still remains really strong. So you can definitely be in a recessionary environment in different pockets of the economy, while other parts are still remaining strong. And that's really the mixed data that macroeconomists are kind of grappling with at the moment. That's why there's so much divergence in whether or not we'll be soft landing or hard landing, what the actual... impacts of tighter monetary policy are, because it's showing up really differently in different parts of the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And Nick, thank you for that breakdown, because one of the things we love to do here for the public community is really unpack. What does the jargon mean? Let's take some of these terms, let's demystify them so that we can help folks make better investing decisions. And it's a great segue to going back to how you open the show, Nick, who said that you guys believe that there are some great opportunities out there in, quote, high quality, fixed income. So tell us where you're seeing some attractive debt out there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so if they can go and speak to this. Overall, when we go and talk about what we mean by high quality fixed income is, again, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, there's really good opportunity and that yields are higher. And they're at a point where we haven't seen them in 10, 15 years. But we do still have preference for that higher quality fixed income. That's because, again, The economic backdrop is a bit more muddled at the moment. So I'll let Faye speak a bit more to that though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, just to add some color, maybe some numbers to what Nick was saying, if you consider that you're holding this one-year Treasury bill today for a full year, you're looking at a return of more than 5%. And compared to the last 10 years, that looks a lot closer to 1% when interest rates were extremely low. So as Nick mentioned, we're not expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year, and instead will be in this higher for longer environment for the immediate future. So in short, this really means first, that investors looking for income can now do so in these really high quality portions of the bond market. And this is something that we haven't seen in a really, really long time. And second, that bonds can now act as a diversification for portfolios as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eFaye, let's talk a little bit more about that and how in practice, retail investors can go get the benefit of some of those yield levels and the income we've talked about. On the one hand, we know that folks can go by treasuries. We know that you can do that for the public platform, for example. But in terms of corporate credit, unpack for us how someone with a public account can go invest in that asset class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so when we're talking about fixed income, it's really important for investors also to consider kind of the credit worthiness of the bonds that they hold. So riskier fixed income reflects higher yields, but the reason for that premium is due to the perceived risk that, you know, there's a smaller chance of being paid back, also known as defaulting. So we're constructive, as Nick mentioned, on high quality exposures, which is typically less volatile than those high yield counterparts. And these are called investment grade exposures. So we're leaning into the investment grade side of the fixed income market versus the more risky high yield exposures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd how does the retail investor get exposure to that? Are there ETFs out there that you're watching? Are there specific direct purchases that's a little bit harder to execute on? How exactly can the public investor get their money into these assets?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a great question, Ann, because one of the ways in which the bond market is sort of set up, and historically it's been this way, is that you most literally have to call your broker-dealer to buy a particular issuance or something along those lines. But with the advent of, like you said, ETFs, is that we can go and take all those bonds, we can put them in an easily accessible wrapper. public.com for instance and they can go and buy a bond ETF. And what that allows is an instant single line item in which you go and get diversification and you get access to all the cash flows associated with the underlying bonds themselves. So it's really a revolutionary way in which investors have access to the bond market in a fashion that they really didn't even 5, 10, 15 years ago. So when we talk about ways to go and access it, ETFs are our primary tool investors can use. You can trade them on exchange during market hours. And it's really easy for investors, rather than going to a website that looks like it was designed in the 1970s to buy treasury bonds. You can go to public.com and actually get access to those through ETFs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and there's a large variety too, like Nick was mentioning. We have investment grade ETFs, treasury ETFs. So there's a lot of choices for investors depending on where they're trying to park their money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk a little bit about how an investor may have a different profile. Depending on income level right now, your report, I'm just looking at it right now, mentions that saving rates have fallen, especially for lower income households. Conversely, the labor market remains strong, depending on which numbers you read, there's somewhere between 10 million and a net 4.4 million of, quote, excess jobs or open jobs out there, depending on how you define these things. How does that translate this declining? household savings rate yet a strong wage rate environment. How does that translate into opportunities for equity investors right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, this is a great question because one of the things that we're seeing is this U.S. consumer that has been very resilient over the past six months to a year. And so when we go and talk about the savings rate, the reason this matters is because at the end of the day, we had a really high savings glut over the COVID era, and that's been slowly spent down. Over that same time, if many people know, is that the labor market's been relatively tight. That means people could switch jobs and people could look for higher wages elsewhere. So those two combinations mean that the U.S. consumer effectively had a lot of extra cash to go and spend. They could spend down their savings while also either moving jobs or looking for higher pay elsewhere. And as a result, we get the environment which we have now in which the US consumer remains in a fairly robust place. Going forward, however, we think that kind of maybe that sort of works itself out and we get back to trend. And in that type of environment, that's where we wanna lean into what we like to call the quality factor. And this is for two reasons. It's because first of all, with the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates, there's a higher cost of capital, costs a lot more for businesses to go and borrow. And in that type of environment, a lot of small companies and their business models start to come under pressure in that world. Also, when you have a slowing US consumer and their ability to spend is not gonna be as much as it was six months ago, that continues to go and put pressure on many of those companies. Means that the inventories that they had may not get sold and will have to start discounting things. It means that their top line, their revenue growth won't be as strong on a year over year basis. So what we really talk about in terms of the opportunities out there, It's leaning into what we call quality, like I said. These are companies with strong balance sheets, really strong free cash flows, who have strong return on equities, and they can continue to go and pass back also a lot of their profits back to shareholders via dividends. So when we talk about quality, that's really what we mean. That's the opportunity out there. And as it relates to where the U.S. consumer is, where those savings rates are, and where the underlying economy is kind of working itself out in the back half of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's interesting Nick and Faye to hear you describe the pockets you're looking at because this idea of quality is core to both your thesis on the fixed income side, Fay specifically said you're focused on investment grade, which is the lower risk, higher free cash flow, stronger balance sheet company typically that gets investment grade ratings. Nick, you're looking for the same thing on the equity side and that profile often translates into dividends. So let's talk about valuation. in that context, right? We've seen this rally in the S\u0026amp;P to highs not seen since before the Fed started to hike rates in 2022. We've seen NASDAQ, which got absolutely beaten down and drumming down last year, have a roaring return this year. So what does that mean, guys? Does that mean you're saying stay away from... growth equities right now to hunker down into dividend yielding equities and investment grade or are you saying something else about portfolio construction?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so the way it actually kind of works itself out is when you go and apply this quality factor especially to the S\u0026amp;P 500 for instance, no matter what you actually go and get this overweight towards those mega cap tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft. And the reason being, makes perfect sense, they are the most profitable companies in the United States. So when we go and look towards that quality factor, it does go and give us that mega cap tech overweight no matter what, but it also goes and gives us exposure to other pockets of the market that continue to also exhibit those same characteristics. It means we're avoiding right now, again, those small caps, those companies whose business models are gonna come under pressure, especially with a higher cost of capital. With that said, there's also a lot of those tech companies that are unprofitable. those companies are reevaluating. They're looking towards profitability, but they're not quite there yet. We think they continue to come under pressure. So if we look at one of the most rewarded factors year to date, it is profitability, and we think that will continue to go and be the case for the back half of the year. So there are opportunities out there. It's not just looking away from those mega cap tech companies and towards what often people say is, the less exciting parts of the market. We still think there are really great opportunities out there. They're just not gonna be in maybe those unprofitable tech names that many people like to invest in, or that are a bit more exciting on a day-to-day basis because of the volatility around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eNick, what are some other pockets that you're seeing the quality factor apply to? And I think about some sectors in that muddy, I think it's the word you use, Nicholas, uncertain environment have tended to fare quite well. It's been the likes of healthcare, pharmaceuticals with relatively predictable flow of cash, at least from those drugs, which they've had on patent for a long time, or they've got established distribution. We've often seen it in certain financials. You saw J.P. Morgan had a rip roaring earnings report. You know Goldman a little bit weaker today, but by and large the financials post the regional bank crisis, the big ones seem to be coming out quite well. And then you've got consumer staples. So when you look at the quality factor, what is it saying about those sectors completely separate and apart from tech?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so as Nick was mentioning, we're leaning into that strategy that, you know, screens for those fundamentals that you think of, those high return on equity, that low leverage. And actually, this is a sector neutral strategy. So as Nick mentioned, it does have that inherent overweight to some of those mega cap tech companies. But instead of taking, you know, specific sectoral bets, our team is instead remaining really constructive on kind of these broad, more sector neutral exposures. So when we think about quality from a factor perspective, that's how we're leaning into it. We're not so much going out, really loud overweight any specific sector. So instead we're taking this broad kind of more benchmark approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eBut when you go and also say, Ann, one of the things that you mentioned was that where are the other pockets of opportunity away from what we would call the boring stuff? And Faye can go and talk more to this because this is her model at heart, which is growth at a reasonable price. So one of the things that we need to talk about is there are growth pockets of the monk. Exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eG-A-R-P\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eOne of the uglier acronyms, for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eThere is growth out there, but what really matters is what valuation are you getting in that?We don't want to be going and buying expensive growth. The companies that – because the relative value that you'll go and get from that is just not going to be as high. So we do go and see growth at a reasonable price in different pockets of the market out there. I would say mostly that's concentrated in places like healthcare and energy right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM:\u003c/strong\u003e We think there's some really strong fundamentals there that continue to go and push those sectors forward. But at the same time, you get a really reasonable price, and that's because they've suffered here today. That's because the overweight that many investors had to them last year has moved back. A lot of investors have sold out of those positions, and it means that it's an under-owned part of the market. And in that case, we think that they can go and continue forward in order to go and offer some attractive returns for investors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting. Let's take a little bit of a different take on this idea of a gap and let's call it mega forces that might be driving longer term growth. That's the term that you use in your report. And these are the kinds of factors that have the potential to impact the inflationary environment to the positive, meaning upward price pressure coming down at longer term. What are some tangible examples of these? Are we going to have to talk about AI? It's impossible to have this conversation at this moment without talking about AI. So let's start there. But I do want to make sure we talk about some other factors as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eI can hop in here. So as you mentioned in our newest publication, we discussed the notion of, you know, the new macro outlook and asset returns being shaped by these structural forces which we've dubbed mega forces. So these are the powerful transformative forces that drive innovation and then therefore kind of, you know, also drive efficiency. So investors have been really laser-focused on these monthly inflation figures over the past couple of years, but we think you know, beyond just this economic cycle. So as you said, you know, we can't get away from this without talking about AI. It's been, you know, seemingly turbocharged since the rollout of ChatGPT at the end of last year. So we're talking about AI, you know, having the power to revolutionize industries outside of just technology, which is how, you know, we've commonly discussed this theme and instead thinking about it in all sorts of different ways from creating new art forms to improving healthcare outcomes. And in turn, that's impacting different companies in all of those industries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd others, let's find others other than AI. What are some of the other mega forces that you guys have identified?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, one of the big ones that we often go and talk about is actually demographics and how those are shaping economies. what it comes down to and just, you know, we have to go back to the basics, which is our classic macroeconomic model of the world and what drives economic growth. It's mostly labor, labor growth, and then labor productivity. So obviously AI goes and influences labor productivity side of the equation. Me and my daily job can go and get things done a bit more efficiently because I'm not responding to, you know, dumb emails or, writing things here or there that normally would take me a while. I can be more efficient in my job overall. But then there's the labor growth side of things. So when we talk about demographics, that's what we mean is where is labor growth actually taking place? In developed markets, labor is actually coming down, and that's because birth rates are relatively low. But when you look towards emerging markets, you continue to go and have this labor growth that's taking place. And as a result, it means their economies are going to continue to go and grow overall. So we look towards places like India as a clear example of a country in which they continue to have a strong or growing population, especially in that 30 to 35 age cohort, because that drives a large part of the economy at the end of the day. So demographics is another big one, but there's also many examples of various mega forces. One of my favorites is actually, when it comes to healthcare, we know that there's gonna be aging populations. People are living longer than ever. That means the healthcare sector overall is gonna have to continue to grow in order to go and ensure that there's positive outcomes for an aging population. So these are things are shaping economies as a whole. They take place over five, 10, 20-year spans. They're not necessarily something that can be, that plays out in the coming months. These are large, broader trends and they should go and influence how as an investor, especially if you're investing for a long term, how you start to go and think about allocating capital at this time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eSounds like we're gonna have to hurry up and wait on some of these mega trends then, Nick and Faye.

We're going to be covering lots of things from The possible TikTok ban and its potential impact. With us today, once again is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. He is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 timeless stop picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts and we are doing a book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public live handle. You see it right there on the top of your screen, folks. All right, it's time to get into it. Hi, Mark. Welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, Kori. Good. Hey, good to hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's good to hear you too. A lot of change actually Mark since I last talked to you. I don't know if you're aware a lot in the financial industry has changed. But today we're gonna focus on the tech stuff and what's happening with TikTok, I mean, the company's CEO, he provided that testimony. He was on Capitol Hill this morning, where he really received some tough, tough criticism with one lawmaker even stating, and I quote, I expect today, you'll say anything to avoid this outcome, but we are not buying it. What were your takeaways from the TikTok CEOs testimony?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that none of my children ever have to go on the Capitol Hill and testify with the weekend that he had, I wouldn't wish that fate on my greatest enemy. So I'm sorry to carry on being kind of glib about it. But that was, you know, I respect him. And I respect him for going up there and taking that, it's kind of like Zuckerberg, you know, in the last year or two or two years ago, being brought up to Capitol Hill to testify. It's kind of like the leaders of tech being brought up there Bezos and, and Tim Cook, etc, are being brought up to testify that was just unfortunately for TikTok, they're going up against two major issues, social health concerns, related to social media usage. And then much more importantly, these days is national security issues. And so, you know, you knew that the question was just how much defense he could play in that time, and I didn't watchall of the testimony. But that's what I was just struck by and I think maybe more importantly, just today's testimony, the action question for all of us as public market investors because we can't invest in TikTok or, or at least not as a separate standalone asset. I don't think we'll ever see it that way, is what are the implications of this for other social media assets, specifically, Snap, Meta, and Google? And I think the probability of TikTok getting banned in the US is just increasing, you know, relatively materially over the last 12 months. I know there are a lot of constitutional issues around this. And I think they're very serious. But I just think that the odds of some sort of ban or major restriction have increased materially. And so that's kind of a pending catalyst. And anytime the news flow comes up, you'll see names like Snap and Meta outperform on that day, which is what you're seeing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel what I'm hacking a little bit more in terms of the broader social media context, because you did reference, you know, Zuckerberg having to go up there kind of, you know, defend all the stuff that Facebook, you know, had going on all the negative things specifically, right, that was happening. I mean, you even saw back in the day with Dorsey, he had to go there. Back when he was still leading his company. He co-founded Twitter. I mean, you see it across the board, it doesn't seem to be net like it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon. And one of my takeaways from what happened today with TikTok, specifically, Mark is that I feel like they're also getting the brunt of all of the aforementioned right, big social media companies. It's like they've had enough time at the batting cage, right? With the Facebooks, with the Googles of the world, with the Snaps that now they're just ready to unleash completely on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori, I think that's right. But no, but don't forget this. I mean, we got a major political issue, growing political tensions between the US and China. And that's what made this tougher, I think, than anything that the tech companies had to face before because, you know, they,Those are US companies, you know, presenting in front of their elected representatives. That's not the case with TikTok and at the moment when relations between the US and China are at the lowest that they've been and, you know, I'm no expert on that. But um, in some time and maybe decades, so it's just, there's just a lot of different angles here that made it much tougher for TikTok to come through and again, it's kind of hard to see a political out here because it looks to look from where I stand it, it looks like the US military has banned Tiktok from personnel devices, personal and personnel devices. You've had more states do that. You've had a federal government do that you'd like that. That's from government-owned devices. So you've already gotten pretty far down the path here. You've never had that happen with any of the other apps. So and that's not because there's a greater social health issue related to TikTok than there was to Snap or to Facebook. It's because of the Chinese national security issue. So that this is just a bigger, this is just my this is more explosive of an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e No, it definitely is something else that you brought up earlier is that you know, you don't think there will ever really see TikTok, as a standalone kind of investable company where people like you or myself, your company would be able to then you know, buy shares in TikTok, it is owned by ByteDance. However, are there some scenarios perhaps in your mind Mark that could play out if TikTok were forced to sell or spin on where it could become, you know, a company at some point that you are I could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well I don't think so. There was an article in the papers this morning in China that the Chinese government for the first time made an official statement that they would be strongly opposed to a forced sale of TikTok. So I mean, I'm no expert on China, I just assumed that there would be some statement that would come out along the way to this effect. Well, it's out. So I think that's why a ban is such a distinct probability, because I don't think ByteDance will be allowed, even if they wanted to, and I don't think they want to, they wouldn't be allowed to sell TikTok to a US company. So TikTok's in the middle of a geopolitical Firestorm that's, it's unfortunate for them. And you know, I give them all credit. This is a highly innovative company now, whether they actually create a national security risk, that's, you know, there are thorough, thoughtful arguments on that. But anyway, that probably matters. Neither here nor less, it doesn't matter now, Kori, we're not gonna be able to get the chance to invest. So let's focus on the companies that could be derivatives of there. That's Meta. Alphabet because of YouTube and Snap. And I really do think sometimes we spend a little too much time on Snap as a derivative. I think that the use case you know, for those who have used TikTok a lot, you think about what other assets like Snap is more of a communications tool than that kind of leaned forward entertainment tool. That TikTok is but the analogies are really, Instagram and YouTube and those would be the beneficiaries where they were TikTok to be banned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, that was a foreign mission company is like Google because of YouTube likes Facebook, obviously, also owns Instagram. This is a perfect lead into my next question, because I know over at Evercore, you guys recently hosted a panel with three experts who collectively oversee $1 billion in ad budgets, these are companies that have really been struggling right in the ad space. But the panel revealed some signs that this ad a winter it could be starting to thaw, could you provide some insight into what you're seeing in the ad space, and how we could you know, positively impact some of those other companies that we could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think we're still in an ad winter, I think that's what we've uncovered so far with, with the channel checks that we've done, maybe that's not terribly surprising. And, you know, there's a broadening consensus that, that we do have a recession coming. So you know, we could be staying in an ad winter for quite some time. I don't think we're going to see crocus's anytime soon. I think Kori, those are the first plants that show up in the snow out of the snow, but you're also into horticulture Mark, you're a man of many talents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e And somebody can correct me on my pronunciation of crocus's. But, but, but I, I don't, I don't think we're gonna get a quick V shape recovery in marketing spend in advertising spend. And so that's going to be a bit of a drag on some of these names. The advantage and one of the reasons we like Meta frankly, one of the reasons it's our number one recommendation is you don't need to believe that to be long Meta, because they've taken so many of the costs out of their business. And then they've got this new reals, monetization, and they're doing much better targeting than they were years ago. And if you've got this new ad format called click to messaging, click the message which is used much less than the US but it's widely used outside of the US especially in areas of the world like Latin America and parts of Asia. And that's, that's a it's a brand new there's like a product cycle here. You need a product cycle because the overall market is getting soft, and it's not good. It's not firming up yet it's not getting better. And we're still in an ad winter and you know, we should probably assume we're gonna continue to be one for as it's gonna be a long winter it's gonna be several more months at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark I don't know. I remember you being this type of pessimistic in terms of the ad winter continuing and then you brought up the dreaded R word recession, goodness, a lot of things in what you just said that are very important takeaways. I'm gonna keep it moving, though, because Amazon, this is a company that has been doing a complete like 180 in terms of its firing, it's not doing the speed hiring anymore. They just announced on Monday, they're gonna lay off another 9000 employees. Do you have any thoughts on this mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think the big backdrop here is actually I thought Amazon was the first of the major tech companies to acknowledge that they had over hired overbuilt during the COVID crisis, they said this on their march 22 earnings call that was the that would have been last April, so about a year ago, but then they didn't really act on it. Whereas I think Facebook didn't acknowledge it early, but then they acted on it by laying off a good number of employees. Look, these layoffs are they're no fun for anybody there painful for all people involved. I've gone through it. And, so I wish it on nobody but you know, just as consumer households have to tighten their belts when times get tough. So do corporations, and especially those that over-hired and over-extrapolated from COVID demand trends. And Amazon was one of those, you could actually look they grew their expenses faster than they grew their revenue, and their revenue grew quickly, from 2019 to 2022. So they did overbuilt, they acknowledged it, and they needed to do one or two rounds of cuts, and they've done the two rounds of cuts. As long as we don't go into a steep recession, I don't think they need to do another round of cuts. But doing those cuts was necessary. You also had a bit of a change in but you've had a major change in management over the last two years. It's given a new CEO who's been with the company for 20 years. So he's not new to Amazon by any means. But it gets given them some time to maybe look through all the portfolio of bets, and assets that Amazon hasn't maybe pair some things back maybe not lose $10 billion a year on Alexa, which was a reported number, which was terrifically high. So anyway, I think I think that's kind of what you're getting out of Amazon, which is they're getting deep now into belt-tightening. And I do think that at the end of the day, when we come out of this, and when we get back to more normal economic times, companies are going to be doing this on the lower cost base. And that means you create what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. So when the revenue recovers on a lower cost base, that means that earnings can grow much faster. And that can be a great long equity opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's definitely hope that it will be really quick, Mark, before I get you out of here. I know that you are recently out in Las Vegas for the PROSPER show, which is a gathering of E-commerce sellers and solution providers just really quickly for all the rest of us who were not able to attend the show. What insights did you take away about the Amazon marketplace from that show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's still remarkably a positive experience for most sellers that are on there. And I think you're seeing a lot of them. I guess one of them the most part, the single most interesting takeaway for me was, I think it was 8 out of the 10. Amazon Marketplace, sellers that we spoke to are currently using advertising on Amazon. And Amazon don't tell anybody this but they're generating close to $40 billion a year in advertising revenue, they're going to be the next $100 billion a year ad revenue company. And that's not going to be next year or the year after. But sometime in the next three to five years. They'll be up there. I mean, they're gonna be in spitting distance of Facebook and Google. And because it's a high-intent platform and marketers and advertisers love to be in high-intent platforms. So that was probably the biggest takeaway. Merchants really like advertising on Amazon, watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow. Well, the faculty said they're going to be in spitting distance of those big behemoths like Google and Facebook. That's definitely something to watch. As always, we love when you come on Public lot to share your insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, the senior managing director and head of internet research team over at Evercore ISI.

I am your host, Kori Hale and today folks, we're going to be discussing Spotify’s recent Stream On event and be updating you on Metas year of efficiency as well as other big tech news. And I'm excited because this is one of my favorite guests we have on the show with us today. It's Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. Mark is also if that wasn't enough, and it is but he is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 times stock picking lessons for one of Wall Street's top tech analysts. And of course, right here on Public, we're doing book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public alive handle. Alright, Mark, welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e It's good to be back, Kori.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e We're always happy to have you join us. And of course, you break down as some of these big tech names on Wall Street, as I mentioned, and we got to talk about Spotify. The streaming platform recently hosted its Stream On event and announced many new features planned for the app. For those of us who maybe did not catch that announcement, could you provide some insight into some of the standout features that were discussed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMark Mahaney: Okay, I think this was their fifth annual Stream On event. It's kind of their product. It's like their customer event, but it's really kind of a product development event. I guess that's what it is. It's it's like, it's like Apple's worldwide developer conference. Now not nearly as impactful or meaningful as that, but it's just this is where they roll out their latest innovations. So there was some new disclosure to the founder, Daniel Eck, the CEO announced that they are now over half a billion monthly visitors, which means that monthly average users, which means that they're now a little bit ahead of their guidance for the March quarter, it's a small thing for the financial folks out there. Second is they disclose that Spotify recommendations are powering more than half of users streams. And why that matters is you know, the more that Spotify is music, people who listen to Spotify, listen to curated music, rather than just going on there and saying, you know, I want this song by Taylor Swift, the extent to which they kind of give the wheel, give the mic, give the turntable that's the right one, Kori, give the turntable to Spotify and say, play me something interesting. That means that Spotify becomes more influential, and that means that artists then want to pay to kind of influence To that influence, or that they're willing to advertise, you know that that creates more of an opportunity for them, you know, the, the retailer who simply just fulfills, doesn't generate margins as nice as the retailer who actually suggests and can and can influence tastes and patterns and things like that. And then the last thing that I thought was interesting is they have a new home feed that's coming out. And I think it's a little bit what I would call the TikTok isation of Spotify. So you're gonna see more TikTok-like features short-form video kind of right up front, you can see sort of a little bit of endless feed is the wrong word, but you're gonna see some of that you're gonna see more than just the static feed when you start. So these are all going to all these little nuances that sort of improve, they also talked about an AI DJ, I'm not sure we're going to really notice a difference, but we'll try it out. And then a new ad format, that's kind of a small video ad format, anything that generates ad revenue for Spotify is going to be good for their gross margins. So those are the features that came out of Spotify’s Stream On on event yesterday,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark, I love that you brought up actually a plethora things that I want to really quickly piggyback off of. And also, we probably have lots of Swifties in our audience, and they probably were like, Mark, we only play Taylor Swift straight through. We don't need any sort of DJ for that. But the interesting thing about what I are what came to my mind was Payola back in the day, which I might be dating myself back in the radio days, when radio was a massive thing, right in artists, more so record labels are paying radio DJs right to play their particular artists. Are you saying then since there's more of this suggesting type of thing that's going to happen with Spotify going forward that there could be some streaming Payola-ish version at some point?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, you're using a very loaded word and Payola and you know, in some senses, that's what it is. But in some senses, maybe we need to rethink it a little bit. So when you use Google search engine, do you think about all those paid ads within Google as Payola? In other words, you know, when when you do a search for, you know, tickets to March Madness games, basketball games, or when you do a search for, you know, Hawaiian, you know, budget, airfare, and you get these paid results in there. I mean, that's essentially I've thought about this as Google's I'm sorry, as Spotify, Googling it search results, you go on there, and you look at today's top country hits, or today's you know, whatever hit it, and hip hop, I think they've got it, they've got something, you know, for a Christian country, I mean, they've got every possible genre you can imagine in there. And if you're an emerging artist, and if you're in a label, you know, this is like, this is a target-rich environment. I mean, these are people listening to your genre, you're a new artist, you know, like to you to here's an opportunity for you to advertise your song so that Italy shows up somewhere in the queue. Now, many people may not listen to your music, but at least here's a chance to market or advertise. And so that's kind of how we think about it. And so I don't know if that answers your question. But that's what that's the exact intent behind Spotify. And what they've done is given labels the ability to market to advertise their newest labels, their newest features, their newest artists, one of the world's largest, most influential music platforms, if you can make it on Spotify, you can make it anywhere. Spotify makes or breaks artists. And then sorry, but that is true, given how they've got half a billion people who listen to the surface, and probably 250 million who listen to it on a daily basis. There's no music listening service outside of YouTube, that's any bigger any more influential than that. And so that's how I think about and I've always thought about it as a great opportunity last year, I think they generate about $200 million in revenue a little bit more than that, from this what is what I call this advertising revenue. I think it's good for Spotify’s business model. And I also do think it creates opportunities for us of the artists that are on Spotify, here's a chance for them to here's a chance for them to promote their work their blood, sweat and toil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, you know what, Mark that makes me think what else do you think is good for Spotify his business model because right now you're holding a price target of $185 on their stock with an outperform rating. What is it beyond that? The fact that they're getting this half a billion monthly active users that really, you know, has you all over at Evercore ISI so pro Spotify?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I am pro Spotify. I was pro-Spotify last year Kori I think you remember that. And the stock tanked. I thought we were going to have an inflection point last year we didn't. And I thought I meant that in terms of gross margins. This is why I like Spotify here and I may be wrong again. You know, but I'm trying to get it right this time. So one, we know that the multiple has come down dramatically on this one This thing goat used to go at four or five, six times, he'd be, you know, enterprise value to sales. Now we're sub two times like that's cheaper than Netflix is cheaper than, well, sort of online dating companies which are somewhat similar. I mean, this is a subscription business and an advertising business, although it's mostly a subscription business. So I think it's cheap. I think the estimates have been de-risk. I think the multiple has then been de-risked. They've started taking some cost actions, they probably overbuilt like a lot of tech companies. So they've been taking some cost actions. But why I particularly like the setup this year, is that I think you're finally at a place where you're going to cut back on some of that podcast investment, heavy spending that they've had. So I think you're finally going to get gross margins to move up. For low gross margin businesses. When you see gross margins move up, it's almost always a major catalyst for the stock. Second is they are likely to implement a price increase their biggest competitors, Apple and Amazon have both implemented a price increase. So it gives it kind of raises the umbrella a little bit and allows them to raise prices. Usually, that's a good thing for companies and for and for stocks. And then the third thing is Kori, last year, they had a record number of new users globally they added the number was something like 70 million. And what typically happens with Spotify is people come on as free users. And then over time, they kind of migrate a decent number of migrate over to be paid subscribers. So if the pick of the record MAU growth last year converts into paid subscriber growth, boom, I got my third catalyst for this year. So that's why I like it. I think the thing can recover to sort of like two times EV to sales. I just don't think that's an aggressive multiple. I know we're in a tough market for for growth equities. This year. This is a company that's been consistently free cash flow positive, admittedly a very small, minimal level, but I do like it and I think it's it's the leading way to play music streaming worldwide. So that's why we that's why we're pitching Spotify is one of our top longs this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e See Mark just because you were wrong last year, that doesn't mean you're wrong. This year. We're not even before three months into the year and Spotify obviously doing pretty well. However, competition this year for Spotify, right also completely ticking up. This is no pun intended specifically with TikTok, right. This is a major competitive threat. Spotify has, you know, acknowledged this, you know, as part of their business model the company is working to obviously expand its streaming globally. TikTok has already said that, do you actually see Tik Tok as a threat to Spotify? Especially with maybe the legal issues by legal I mean regulatory issues around TikTok in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori I may be wrong, but I don't think so. I think the bigger competitive risk really is Apple Music. YouTube music, Amazon music. Those are kind of the more direct So, let's see. Yeah, I think I'm not sure the competition is greater. But yes, TikTok has got a, you know, huge audience worldwide. It's one of those things where can the brand really be stretched? Are people going to really think about like, TikTok is a wonderful experience for you know, for consumers. It's just highly entertaining, addictive, maybe, but also truly highly entertaining. But it's a different type of entertainment than music. And I'm in one of the problems that TikTok is apparently having is getting the rights that Spotify spent a lot of time getting from the labels. So I just, I'm not at all sure that TikTok is going to come out and directly compete with, with Spotify. I'll take the other side on that I may be wrong. I worry about the other companies. But I've just noticed in the seven years I've been running surveys on Spotify, every year, they seem to gain more share of ear can I say that, share of ear you know, like their their share of people listening to streaming music on Android devices. And by the way on Apple devices has pretty consistently risen over the last couple of years. So they're doing something right the real issue on the stock and why it hasn't done anything since its IPO is or direct listing is the business model and people want to see the gross margins go up people want to see them start generating substantial amounts of free cash flow they generate minimal amount but let's get chunky. Let's get a lot of free cash flow. I think they can start gapping up that gross margin this year start growing it I think 10 People can start believing again that there can be sizable free cash flow and that could cause the rewriting in the stock to go up this year. That's why I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e All right. No, I I'm with you on that Mark. I want to shift really quickly while we have some time though and cover another big tech company which is Facebook's parent company Meta they're entering into their year of efficiency are since entering I guess it's continuing as the social media giant is expected to layoff thousands more or employees as early as this week. Might I also add it is not lost on me that a company that's shifting into a year of efficiency, which is away from the metaverse after they changed the parent company name to Meta is a lot of questions in my mind around that. However, this is the second largest scale cut these layoffs by Meta. How many more can investors expect as part of this year of efficiency?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I do think it's necessary the year of efficiency. You know, we there's two factors that are going on here. One is that overall demand trends are softening for macro economic reasons. And so layoffs aren't fun. I've gone through them, you know that they're painful for everybody involved, especially if you're one of those people getting laid off. But you know, when times get tough, we all the households tighten their belts and companies need to tighten their belts. And one way you do that, is you unfortunately have to let go some of your employees. The other thing, though, that's one factor. But the other one that Jim maybe just as material and maybe more so is that there clearly are some companies that overbuilt post the COVID crisis, I think Amazon was one I think, Meta was one if you were to go back and look at the revenue growth between 2019 and 2022. And then the OPEX growth, your operating expense growth, you'll see there's a couple of companies that really stick out that they grew their expenses more than their revenue, even though revenue shot up materially between 2019 and 2022, the expenses grew even more. And I think these companies sort of assumed that there was this positive inflection and demand for the services that we kind of continue on for many, many years. That didn't happen. It's not like we've gained, it's not like we've reverted to 2019. It's just that the growth rates have kind of more normalized, rather than just kind of kept it accelerating level. Anyway, all of that is Meta was one of those companies, demand trends are softening for online advertising, no question about it as they are for all marketing spend, and this company over hired, and it's probably the right thing for them to do to take these layoffs. I you know, I think what's been reported recently, I think that is probably going to happen. There's enough there's enough smoke there. There's got to be some hiring fire. I think that's good. I think that actually was a surprisingly good pun. And then I'm going to use that in the note thank you, Kori. And then, but yeah, so I think that's happened. And I think it helps, what investors want to see is defend the bottom line, you know, you can't control what's going to happen to you know, ad marketers, and how much they're going to spend in a recession, you can control your cost basis, and show me that you're going to do that show me your grown-up company. And Zuckerberg kind of weaved and waved a little bit last year. But I think he got to the I think he finally I think most of the signals he gave were it Yes, I'm a mature company, CEO. I'm a CEO, I'm a mature CEO of a company, it may be a mature company. And we need to be much more careful about expenses. And it's not growth at all costs. And when he started to do that, I think he's been rewarded by the market. And I think there's more of that coming. And I also think that the revenue growth trends are going to improve at Facebook because I think they're improving their ad tracking their ad attribution models. And I think they're going to be able to better monetize reels, which I think has turned out to be phenomenally successful for both Instagram and Facebook in terms of new users and more engagement. So I really like Meta here. I think it's still cheap at 14 times earnings. And I think there's 50% upside in the stock. So it's actually my number one pick right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow, number one pick. I didn't know that's where you were going with that mark. But that's that's a strong conviction there. Okay. Number one pick, you know what I was thinking to in the broader tech scheme, something I'd love to get your insights on. We don't have time to do it today. So we'll have to have another session. But I really want to pick your brain around chat GPT around Microsoft's login strategy, how you see that playing into revenue. What does that do to Google? Especially because you brought up ads of the like and how that all could really up in certain business revenue lines across different tech companies. I don't know if you've given that any thought but I'd love to hear what you have to say on that next time around. Next time around. All right, everyone. This was a great session. By the way I love this and I we always love when Mark comes on and shares his insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the interset internet research team over at Evercore ISI don't forget about the book giveaway that we're doing DM us and Public Live handle today.

Joining us today is Paul Graves, CEO of Livent. Livent is a lithium manufacturer powering a range of technologies that impact our everyday lives, including the revolution in electric vehicle batteries and mobile devices. With that, Paul, thanks very much for joining us.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks, Ann. Good morning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's start off with a brief overview of what Livent does. If you just break down the technology and applications of your products, that'd be super helpful.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, sure. You know, I'm sure we're gonna get into a little bit of conversation about what exactly lithium is, but Livent is the former FMC lithium, its predecessor company, started in the 1940s. So we've been around a long time, we basically make all the major forms of lithium, so the major funds lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, lithium chloride, lithium metal, and have done for many, many years. Our primary product, though, is lithium hydroxide, which is a form of lithium that is used in the manufacture of that higher nickel content batteries that you see in Teslas and other premium vehicles. So the bulk of our business today, at least, is lithium hydroxide.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI feel like I'm back at school in learning the periodic table with all the different formulations. So lots to keep up with. Tell us then a little bit about the partnerships that you have - Tesla, you mentioned BMW and General Motors, to what capacity are you guys working with the automotive and battery manufacturers?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEach of these manufacturers and basically, most manufacturers, frankly, outside China today, are prioritizing batteries that are using a technology that is a high nickel battery. The reason they do that is simply more energy density and just the profile of that battery is more appropriate for what they're trying to do in terms of extended range, etc. To make those batteries as I said, they need lithium hydroxide. And the reason that they partner with us and we partner with them from their perspective, they're just very few places in the world where you can acquire lithium hydroxide of a quality and of a grade that is usable in a battery application, the process of qualifying can take a year. In fact, we know that one of our competitors spent almost six years getting qualified into a specific battery application.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo this is not a substitutable product and so you have to form partnerships. The same is true, by the way, for us because every single battery manufacturer wants slightly different characteristics in their lithium hydroxide. So also, they can't just run out and buy this product over the counter on a market. They can't they can't pick it up anywhere and just use it. There are some pretty large liability issues for battery failures for OEMs, and we've seen that in the past. And so this idea of having a very reliable, high quality supply of lithium hydroxide is really important to these OEMs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen we look at the underlying demand then for license products and we focus in on this EV and market how dependent in your mind Paul is us, EV adoption on government policies specifically?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I think most EV adoption around the world is due to some form of government intervention, whether it's industrial policy in China, or whether it’s regulatory policy in Europe, particularly climate policy, or whether it's something in the middle, frankly, in the U.S. So every country is dependent on that. If the question is, how important is the US market to the global EV industry, it's easily the third out of the three major economic groupings in terms of lithium demand without me read your mind, with China clearly being way ahead of everybody else, Europe catching up quickly and the U.S.\u0026nbsp; very much in third place.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk about China then Paul has to start the year. We've seen headline declines and Evie demand numbers in China lithium prices in China down by nearly a third relative to November highs. What does that mean for your business? And is this a concerning trend?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I'm going to tell you, the data just frankly, isn't reliable. We don't see prices falling in China, we haven't seen that. It's really a function of there's a lot of there's a lot of forces at work. But looking at a reference price in China, whether it's a fast market and SMM or whoever it may be, is trying to capture a marginal trade in a lithium product that is very rarely representative of the broader market. And I think you may have seen our earnings, you know, we're guiding the way that our average realized prices, is going to be significantly up year over year and we've certainly seen that in January.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the same is true of EV sales. We always see a dip in January in China because of the lunar holidays. We just saw February data a day or two ago and EV sales in February were up 40% year over year. So we just don't see this dip in sales that everybody else is speaking to. And we certainly don't see any evidence of a reduction in demand for lithium products as a result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e And just to put this in context, we live in what is the business's exposure to the Chinese market at a macro level?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, almost every battery maker today is producing a significant proportion of its cathodes – cathode materials in China, I think it's something like 80-85%, so for a lithium producer, it's extremely difficult to have no China exposure. Our business tends to be though, with Western applications for those cathodes. So we may supply them lithium hydroxide from our U.S.. plant which largely will go to Korea or Japan, or will supply from our China plant which will largely be processed in China, but the resulting cathode or battery or cell is leaving China and ending up in a western OEM.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk a little bit about some headline news that hit last week poor the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker contemporary Amperex Technology announced it was changing its pricing strategy and signing contracts with EV makers at “discounted prices.” \u003c/span\u003eWe saw lithium stocks including Livent you know, take a bit of a hit following that news. Could you just talk a little bit about your reaction to what is this something that's shaking up the market? Or is this a temporary hit to supply demand dynamics?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I think the move in the share price, it shows you how emotional investors are about lithium, unfortunately. There's not a lot of analytics behind the way we trade on a daily basis. It’s clear what CATLR have offered is first and foremost, this offer is only as far as we can tell to Chinese OEMs. So it's not an offer to anybody else. Secondly, that OEM must commit to buy over 70% of their batteries from CATL. In order to achieve that, and then they will price the battery as though lithium is at I think for lithium carbonate $30 equivalent. CATL is frankly largely a carbonate based battery producer, not hydroxide, we don't have a massive amount of exposure to CATL. We do have some - not to any Chinese manufacturers that we're aware of.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'd also point out that in 2022 Livent’s average realized price for lithium wasn't $30 it was lower than that. And so it's not like $30 is suddenly this catastrophic price. If you go back a couple of years, the industry really wasn't expecting to see pricing north of $20 for any sustainable period. So for CATL to say that now in the long run, they're gonna guarantee $30 I mean, to me, it just fundamentally is an acknowledgment and an admission that the historically low prices of lithium are not coming back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo there's been an upward rebasing that's interesting. You know electric vehicles\u0026nbsp; have really captured the imagination of the market, and particularly here on Public. We see a lot of interest in that use case, but live it when you actually go and read about the company, your products are using so many more end markets, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, take us a little bit through some of those other end markets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's interesting if you go back, not even six or seven years, we IPO’d in 2018. And the bulk of our business was not into automotive applications. And I think it was not until 2021 that it actually tipped over the edge. Even today in energy storage applications, EVs globally are between 55 and 60% of total installed capacity on a gigawatt hour basis. So EVs while they're \u0026nbsp; the biggest part of the energy storage industry, there's 40% or so that is non EV and application. For us, we have a little unusual business and I told you the beginning we have all the products and the lithium chloride and lithium metal chain, which by the way is the key to future solid state batteries will be the lithium metal side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eToday, lithium metal is largely used in a product we make up utility. Put any chemist on the phone. And you'll get excited about utility for some bizarre reason. But it's a product that's used to manufacture lots of other stuff, everything from drugs, polymers, a whole bunch of synthesis applications, it's got very, very broad applications that makes about a third of our revenue today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen I look at your business pool, and folks can find this in your earnings results, in 2022 numbers, it looks like revenue came in at $813 million adjusted EBITDA at $367 million. So there's heft and scale to your business that's been engaging in a number of capacity expansion projects. Can you talk a little bit for us about what it is like to be undertaking expensive capital intensive construction projects in a rising rate environment?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's an interesting challenge for certainly being more profitable helps us fund this. We also have no net debt, we have about 200 million of cash on our balance sheet today. Largely, frankly, because customers are stepping up for companies like Livent that are credible, that can actually have demonstrated that we can actually producing usable lithium chains, they're willing to commit capital to help us expand. Expanding is hard, lithium is incredibly difficult to produce, because it really, really has two steps to it. And the vast majority of expansions or even companies out there with lithium in the name actually will never produce any usable lithium, they'll produce an intermediate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat we're trying to build is a fully integrated resource all the way through the chemical plant operations. We do that today, through our resource in Argentina. Our resource in Argentina was about 4,200 meters or 13,000 feet above sea level. So it's incredibly remote and there’s villages 110 kilometers away. And we are trying to put over a billion dollars of capital into expanding that mine and it just takes a long time. A lead time for items in every industry, but certainly because of the EV boom, the same is true of nickel or copper, there's a lot of overlap in material, it can take us two or three years to actually get pieces of equipment delivered. So it's an arduous and complicated process, to be perfectly honest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then just the last question for you, Paul, which touches on this issue of policy, you've talked about your footprint in China, you've just touched on your footprint in Argentina. How much.. and this is really at the industry level not necessarily at the moment level, how much are you seeing impetus, at least from a policy perspective to do more in your production process here in the United States?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e It's a mixed bag and a mixed message. I think it's fair to say at the federal level, there's a desire to bring as much of the value on shore. The value if you think about the chain starts in mining run through chemical processing into manufacturing of cell components to the cells the cell packed and ultimately the vehicle. And I think it's probably far too fair to say that most policy starts at the vehicle and works its way backwards. And in terms of its desire to have the actual production on shore, there's a debate about whether they really want mining in the U.s. and that's certainly the case at the local level.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen you get into states or local communities we do get huge push backs as an industry or in the mining industry about mining in the U.S. It’s different in Canada but in the U.S., it's not entirely clear to me that there's a big policy commitment to the mining. They do want the chemical process and we have a site at Bessemer city in North Carolina where we produce lithium hydroxide. We just built another 5,000 ton plant there and we've committed to build another 15,000 ton plant there. So there is definitely commitment to that but the material that feeds that plant will ultimately come from Argentina, not from a minor the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLots going on in the industry, everyone that was Paul Graves, CEO of Livent. Paul, thank you so much for joining us and we will be keeping our eyes out on the trends in EV in particular that you highlighted for us today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Thanks a lot.

I'm your host Kori Hale and I'm thrilled to be here with you as part of Public and Culture Banks is Black History Month series in which we'll be talking to builders and thought leaders to gain perspectives into issues and opportunities that have particular relevance to the black community, which makes me super excited. So for today's show, we're going to be unpacking the business side of nio changes that name, image and likeness that came to the collegiate sports world in 2021. Our guests today are Brandon Wimbush and Ayden seal, which I hope Aiden, I'm saying your last name correctly. They're the cofounders of mobile, which is an nio compliant marketplace for athletes and brands. Braden Aiden, welcome to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e It's nice to meet you guys. Thank you for having us. We're really excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e We're definitely happy to have you in Ayden. I actually think I'm gonna kick this off with you. For our community members and listeners right now I'd love for you to give us some quick context exactly on what nio means Here's how it's changed in the past few years since coming to collegiate sports in 2021. And really what this means for those college athletes to be able to monetize their own names?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely Kori, it's such a pleasure to be here. So thank you for this opportunity. So for our listeners, what name image and likeness means it's effectively the ability for a student athletes. So that's a collegiate athlete, and now in some high school states as well, the ability to monetize their publicity rights and make money off of their platform and audience. Now, it's important to clarify, this is not referred to pay for play, universities are not compensating any of their athletes for direct performance on the field. However, now student-athletes throughout the country can explore opportunities to monetize their publicity, and their platforms, and audiences by connecting with brands for sponsorship opportunities, engaging with fans for exciting and NIL monetization opportunities, and anything else that they historically have not been able to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is clearly a massive deal. And we've seen, you know, a lot of college athletes that perhaps, you know, we kind of heard about, but we really didn't see them making any money unless they were able to make it to the professional level. So Brandon, I'm gonna bring this to you exactly. How long have collegiate athletes been fighting for these new type of policies? And I'm gonna throw in something else here because I think of a company like overtime, sports and what they're doing at the high school level. Is it possible as well, that we can see this trickle down?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Wimbush:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, Kori. college athletes have really been fighting for this ever since the NCAA since the inception of the NCAA, right, which is over a century-long. I think it really took the front stage during Ed O'Bannon, recent case, which went to the court in 2009. So I'm sure some of you guys remember Ed O'Bannon. Being on the national championship basketball team. UCLA's national championship basketball team in 1995. And the fact that the NCAA continued to use his NIL, after his collegiate career and some of his teammates, right, that sparked up a lot of interest around not only the ability for college athletes to make money, but how else the NCAA was exploiting and some of the antitrust laws that the NCAA was, you know, kind of proposed with, if you will, right, so this has been a this has been many decades in the in the works. It came about super quickly. The first, the first governor to enact some NIL laws was California's Governor Gavin Newsom in 2019. When actually when he was on the LeBron James show the shop, he had signed a bill that was going to allow college athletes in the state of California to make money come 2023. But obviously, so much had progressed since that viewing and you know, things kind of took a quick turn. And obviously, we're here right after July of 2021. When when everything went into effect at a national level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eBrandon, do you think that we can see maybe some high school athletes be able to one day monetize their NIL?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Wimbush:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, of course. Sorry about that. I forgot the second part of your question. But like even mentioned, there are some high school there are some states now that are allowing high school athletes. I think we're up to maybe 20 or so states on the high school level, they're allowing their athletes to, to make money. And from our perspective, it's great, right? It's great that, you know, some I mean, you guys are probably familiar, the most recent big stories around the quarterback that was committed to the University of Florida, had an NIL deal. I believe it was signed, or whatnot. And it was for around $13 million. But then that contract had fallen through. And now he's, you know, decommitted he got to appeal. His is his LOI, which is the letter of intent that you sign, which generally doesn't happen. So it just adds it's adding a new component to all levels of sports, high school, college sports, and how we're thinking about it from the high school level Kori is we want to be able to educate you have more than you know, I don't even know the numbers, right, but millions of high school athletes, and 99% of them really won't be able to monetize on a massive level. So how can we help those athletes still with the ability to monetize and build their personal brands, so when those athletes who do get to college, they have a little bit of a head start?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, that's definitely important and actually like that you mentioned LeBron James earlier because it actually is his son, who really sits at the top of the NIL mountain and he is someone who's in high school and not in college, but pulls in, you know, five plus million dollars a year. So we're definitely seeing it at different levels. But I want to bring this back to the broader mogul company and our platform that you all have created. I mean, it is this marketplace for athletes to connect with brands for these NIL deals that we're referencing right now. And Ayden, I'm gonna bring you back in on this, and what are some of the main pain points that you're solving for both sides of this marketplace?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, Kori. So the number one pain point that we're solving for both for student athletes and for brands looking to engage with these incredibly powerful influencers is just access. So on the student-athlete side, when you think about a student-athletes experience at school, they largely don't have access to these brands, the time in their schedule to source these opportunities, the experience doing so, or the ability to really figure out exactly what their brand identity is. So for us, what we're doing is we're providing a seamless and most importantly compliant solution for these student-athletes to connect with brands, and also fans for monetization opportunities. On the brand side, the value that we're providing to them is that there are 500,000 collegiate athletes throughout the country. And it's now been proven and the data backs it that this subset of influencer is 12 times as valuable as the next subset of influencer across social media. So what we're doing is we're providing brands the ability to directly connect with thousands of these influencers at one time, in order to reach new markets, hard to reach markets, and specifically target Gen Z audiences as they look to build awareness for their products and services. Now, when you take the platform into account, there's obviously a lot of benefit to using a platform like mobile in when engaging with athletes. So number one, is a seamless connection and communication process associated between a brand and an athlete. Number two, you're ensuring that your student-athletes that you're working with are protected, and that their eligibility remains intact because that activity is automatically being disclosed to their university compliance policies. And then number three, we actually save brands a lot of time, money and effort by automatically generating contracts for them to engage with athletes on as well. So we're saving them a ton of time, money and effort when engaging with this incredibly powerful and valuable subset of influencers. And then for student-athletes, we're broadening their horizon and connecting them to exceptional opportunities with leading brands and local businesses as well, in a fully compliant and seamless way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Ayden, what are some of these brands that you guys are working with? Let's hear a few names.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, absolutely. So the one of the beautiful things about mogul is that we're not only working with Fortune 500 brands, but we're also working with local businesses throughout the country, because of our commitment. And our thesis when we started this that all college athletes provide value within the name image and likeness landscape. So some of the brands that we've worked with over the past couple years that you'd recognize are Toyota, Activision, DoorDash, Allbirds. And then we're extremely excited as well about a partnership that we've structured with NBC Sports, in which we're helping NBC Sports to manage their NIL activities on behalf of their advertising network. Additionally, you know, in markets like Austin, Texas, Columbus, Ohio, Ann Arbor, Michigan, we've connected local delis, burger joints, gyms, health and wellness companies, to student-athletes, as well, because these student-athletes provide essentially a bridge and an avenue directly into the undergraduate population. Which, if you've ever been to a college town in the US, you understand that college towns like South Bend, Indiana revolve around that population and ultimately, their business as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, they definitely do. Aidan and I've been to many college towns as an alumni of Syracuse University and Hampton University in Virginia. I know exactly what you mean. And I love that you brought up the fact that you know, it's all college athletes right that deserve this type of opportunity with NIL deals, which Brandon brings me back to you because you were a former college athlete at Notre Dame. So what is your perspective as a former college athlete you bring to mobile and why do you think having an athlete boys such as yourself at the table? Why is that so important?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Wimbush:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, Kori Before I move on to that question that central recognizing that it's Black History Month, the deal that we did with Toyota was with two HBCU athletes, and one was Monet Davis, who people probably remember from Little League World Series, and I think it was 2012. And now she's grown up, and she's a successful softball player at Hampton and we got to work with her because Toyota prioritizes, their involvement with HBCU programs across the country. So that was pretty awesome. And one that we're really excited about. As far as just having the athlete perspective, kudos to Ayden, you know, he originally drew up the business plan, way, way, way, way before NIL was even taking into into effect in 2019. And we had known each other we're both from northern parts of New Jersey, so we had connected, went to rival high schools, and we known each other from Notre Dame as well. And so he reached out to me to kind of gain the athlete understanding of, you know, going about building a marketplace and a product that was going to serve college athletics. What does the athlete kind of want? And how can a product like this benefit them? So from that point on, we had that initial conversation, I was like, let's take this one step further. I think the athlete perspective is going to be so pertinent to your experience building a company, and you should have somebody you know, someone like myself, who had played at a high level, but then also went through so many trials and tribulations, right. Like, I think me getting benched in my second year of playing is a perfect example of market your marketability, while it's at its peak, right? Obviously, I'm very fortunate played quarterback at Notre Dame. So it's kind of on the, it's kind of, you know, on the side of not being, you know, the common ground for NIL, right. And that's kind of where we're servicing is that middle ground of that 99% 98% of athlete who's not going to have that ability to go play professionally. And so we've been able to really tap in with to that 90% of our team, internally, are former collegiate athletes, and their swimmers, their track runners, the wrestlers that we have, right, but it's, it's that ability to connect with athletes, that I think gives us a leg up in terms of understanding what they go through on a daily basis, how they're going to want to navigate an app, right, just like understanding that use of use component of building out an app for college athletes, like, you know, we want everything to be done in a streamlined manner. We're generally very organized, we don't want to have to go through many steps. And so that ability in that understanding has been in served and valuable for us these past 20 months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Brandon, I love that you mentioned that the majority of your staff, the majority of your team and mobile are former athletes, it's making me think you guys must have some like one of the biggest groups of former athletes as employees outside of like a sports media type of company. So I think that's really, really cool. But I want to dig in a little bit deeper on the NIL deals given that you are a former athlete, how equitable are some of the deals that you're seeing come across your platform?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Wimbush:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think they're pretty equitable. I think what we do a good job of is giving open visibility to brands to see some of the other opportunities that live on the platform. And then they can understand the traction that those types of campaigns have from other brands, and in terms of being able to attract the talent that they want to attract. You know, as far as the athletes go, and I guess to my point earlier of like, kind of being on the other spectrum, the NIL deals that we see in public are really not NIL right, like, I mean, it's, it obviously is NIL but it's the high school kid making $10 million. And Bronnie James making $6 million coming in. That's not what we're servicing. And that's not what the common college athlete is going through. And so people have to understand that that's, that's very far in between. And so we really feel and have done a good job of educating the brands that come to the mobile platform, shout out to our sales team and the people internally that educate the brands on hey, here's how to best suit or create a campaign and an opportunity that's going to be able to attract all of our 8,000 athletes that we have on the platform, right? So brands have done a phenomenal job of that. There's more data to go around now, right within the entire NIL marketplace. female athletes have really really done a phenomenal job. And I would argue lead the way in terms of NIL and, and brand building and just success in this space. And it's been phenomenal to see 60% of the athletes on our platform are female sports. You know 65% of revenue generated on our platform has been from non-revenue generating sports, right? So that's all sports other than your football, and men and women's basketball. So we've seen some really phenomenal, equitable success, we would argue on our platform, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eKnow that sounds amazing. And you know, guys, this has been a very strong 20 minutes here. So Ayden and I actually like to wrap things up with this final question out to you because, you know, we're still very early in this entire NIL process, as I referenced, it's just really came to collegiate to athletes, officially in 2021, besides some of the early stuff that the governor of California was doing back in 2019. So what do you think the future holds when it comes to brand partnerships with college athletes and what's really the long-term opportunity for businesses?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, of course, frankly, the sky's the limit as it relates to the future. One of the things that we've observed only in the two years since name image and likeness has been around is that individual student-athletes have drastically expanded the value that they can actually provide to brands because they've honed in on influencer marketing strategies and skills. They've identified what brands their personal brand would provide the most value to and whom they align most closely with. But also, as more and more college athletes get educated both at the institutional and university level, but also in the market in general, this industry, and the opportunity for brands is only going to expand. Now, as it relates to brand partnerships with college athletes. I think this just becomes more and more of the status quo, right? Obviously, right now, we're referring to this whole industry as name image and likeness. But ultimately, this isn't going anywhere. And it's not being repealed anytime soon or ever. So as a result, I think these influencers in general are just going to be more associated as standard traditional influencers, as opposed to all of their deals constantly being marketed or tagged as Oh, this was a name, image, and likeness deal. And as more brands witness and observe their competitors, and other members of their industry leveraging this incredible solution, we think that this is only going to grow. Yeah, we're extremely excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e And I'm excited for this super cool platform that you guys are doing and because you have the opportunity to make a very big difference in the life of many collegiate athletes.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eHello everybody and welcome to Public Live. I'm your host Ann Berry and looking back, it has been a bit of a bumpy and unpredictable year in the markets. But some pockets did see momentum, one of them being electric vehicles, which stand to benefit potentially from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed earlier this year. So that's what we're going to focus on today, electric vehicles or EVs, their latest developments, and what's on the horizon as we head into 2023. Here to discuss all of this is Jay Jacobs, US head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares. Jay, welcome back to Public Life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd thanks so much for having me. It is great to be back on Public Live for one more time in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eI cannot believe 2022 is nearly over. I feel like the EV sector share, when you look at their share prices, are probably pretty glad that we're going into a new year, a new chapter, and putting this one behind us definitely had a busy couple of years, we have seen looking back at this year an increased interest from consumers, two major ride-hailing companies all promising to adopt electric vehicles into their fleets and the industry has been one that just can't seem to slow down. So I'd love to kick off today's show with you by walking through some of the highlights that you've tracked from the last year in the sector.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I would say there are a few things. You know, first off, this was really kind of the year where EVs became less of a niche product and more of a mainstream product. We see that in adoption numbers. So if you look at the first half of 2022, EVS made up 26% of car sales in China, about 20% of passenger car sales in Europe, and the US actually lagging behind by only about 6%. But that is still very big numbers in a very large market around the world, showing that EVs are really coming onto the scene in a meaningful way. You add, on top of that, that we've had several car models come out this year. So basically, every major car brand has an EV now, and you see, it's not just sports cars, SUVs, it's vans, it's lower price sedans, really a model for every kind of buyer and price point out there. And then finally, yeah, we have the Inflation Reduction Act, which is one of the largest commitments ever to support the adoption of electric vehicles and clean energy, about $370 billion from the US government over the next 10 years or so, which is going to provide things like subsidies for building EV subsidies for buying EVs to really accelerate the growth of this segment. So it was, yes, 2020 was a difficult year for almost any investor in any segment of the market. EVs not being the exception. But there were a lot of things to still get excited about in the Eevee space and 2022.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eJay, let's break down a little bit more the legislation and hone in on the role of the Inflation Reduction Act. You hit the headlines for $370 billion over how long is that investment going to be made?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it's roughly over about 10 years. This doesn't all get spent at once. And that's kind of the design, right, is that what the IRA is trying to do is accelerate the adoption of a technology that otherwise is seeing good adoption, but the US government wants to do it faster. And there are really two different ways to do that. One is increased demand. And the easiest way to increase demand is to make something cheaper. So the way that they're doing that is a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, a $4,000 tax credit for used EVs, spurring demand by making them more affordable. The other way to do that is to increase supply. And that's actually incredibly important in the market that we're in today. Because there are actually not enough EVs to buy right now. If you try to buy a Ford F150 Lightning, you can't do it. If you want to buy, you know, some of the top models, you know, model three long ranges and make Mustangs, there are long waits, if you can even get on a waitlist right now. So the idea is, how do we spur more supply by using things like incentive tax credits and production tax credits to get these companies to build more manufacturing plants in the United States as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting that you break down the demand and supply aspects of it so succinctly, Jay. When you think about which of those pieces are going to have the nearest term momentum, tax credits for purchasing EVs, when are they going to kick in, and then subsidies for buying more EV plants? When are they going to start getting kicked in?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen the tax credits get hit as early as next year? The tax credits for building manufacturing plants could also start to come into play next year. But you know, we have to realize building a manufacturing plant is a two to three-year, four-year process even so we're not really going to see the commercial benefits of that for some time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's let's look a little bit more at trends for 2023, specifically Jay, which industries are looking to add EVs to their fleets? The famous one, of course, was Amazon, which had an agreement with Rivian to try and bring EVs into their delivery fleets. What are the other examples that you can walk us through of different industries moving into electric vehicle adoption?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think two are really exciting right now. So one is when we look at semi trucks, so the 18-wheelers you see on the highway, very expensive vehicles that use a lot of gas. We're starting to see progress in the electrification of that fleet. And astute listeners may have noticed the Tesla semi has been tested on the roads recently, with companies like PepsiCo putting in orders for dozens of Tesla semis going forward. So that's a really exciting development in switching the fleet from gas to electric. And then secondly, this just came out yesterday; the US Postal Service, which is the biggest operator of vehicles in the federal government in the United States, is going to put in place about 66,000 electric vehicles over the next decade or so. So this is massive, this is going from, you know, just electric vehicles being kind of a niche sports car, to really being the predominant form of passenger vehicles or light-duty vehicles or even heavy-duty vehicles and the Tesla semi example going forward. So these are exciting times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is x 1000s. Quite the number doing know, Jay, which manufacturers and which brands are going to be procured from.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, they're there from a couple of brands. One is Oshkosh, which is more of a military supply company, but builds a lot of postal service car tracks, and the others are going to come from the private sector, more from major car brands even announced which ones yet. Here's the fun fact, though, the little postal service truck that people have seen on the roads for decades only gets about eight miles per gallon. So you can see pretty quickly how switching to an electric really ramps up the efficiency of the postal service not just to reduce emissions, but to reduce operating costs; no longer paying so much for gas can actually really lower costs for shipping.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk a little bit about EV stocks, Jay, because for people interested in electric vehicles and looking to play in the market, I'm curious if you'd be able to share some of the high-level signals or metrics that you and your team look for when evaluating EV players?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. So really, the primary thing that we look at is revenue from the EV ecosystem. Now the art in that is really what is the EV ecosystem. It's very obvious to say that EV manufacturers, like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already, are very key to the electric manufacturers like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already are very key to the electric vehicle theme. But it actually goes far beyond that. And so you can think about, you know, who are the companies that actually build the batteries that go into electric vehicles, they're obviously part of the ecosystem, who's doing the lithium mining and processing that goes into those batteries, who's building the electronics and the parts that are supplied into electric vehicles. And there are really dozens of companies beyond some of the headline names that are really participating in the ecosystem. We often call this thematic beta or thematic risk, the risk here being these companies are tied to the potential adoption of electric vehicles. If the adoption for electric vehicles happens the way that we expect it to, these companies will be rewarded for that risk. If electric vehicles get supplanted by new technology, or for some reason, don't make it, they don't get escape velocity, and the internal combustion engine lives on, then companies with this thematic risk would be punished. But what we are really looking at is what are the companies that have that highest thematic risk to the electric vehicle ecosystem. And we really measure that by who gets the most revenue from electric vehicles and the entire ecosystem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd how about in the US versus internationally? I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act here in the US has caused enormous momentum domestically. Are there players you look at or parts of the supply chain that you look at internationally and that are publicly traded?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, this is a theme that is not confined to borders. Yes, we saw, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States. You know, we've seen other efforts in China and Europe to spur greater electric vehicle adoption as well. So it's really a global theme, and we see global companies participating in it. There are a lot of battery manufacturers coming from South Korea and beyond. There are a lot of lithium miners in Australia. There are parts suppliers all around the world as well. So when we think about this theme, we are absolutely looking at it through global hubs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCan we talk a little bit about how EV ETFs work Jay, as an investor, thinking about adding EV exposure to their portfolio\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. So EV ETFs are really trying to get exposure to that EV ecosystem by investing in companies around the world. So, for example, our IDRV ETF and iShares invest in lithium mining companies, refiners, battery producers, and car manufacturers in the electric vehicle space, as well as part suppliers, and really provides exposure to that entire ecosystem in one ETF. This has many benefits for investors, but one of them being it's hard to identify these companies on your own because they're not just US large-cap brand names. It can be smaller international companies. It's just hard for individual investors to access this ecosystem at the individual stock level. Secondly, there's just a lot of efficiency and doing this through an ETF rather than going out and buying 50 companies around the world on your own. You can put in an order for one ETF like IDRV and get exposure to that entire basket with one trade. So, you know, when we design an ETF like IDRV, we're really focused on capturing the pure-play companies across the entire ecosystem of a theme, in this case, electric vehicles, to get that exposure to investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd then, Jay, could you give us a little bit of color on a couple of things that help with the myth-busting? Because EVs have tended to seem like the cars of the future. They're sort of here with us now. But what are some of the assumptions that people may still have about electric vehicles that maybe just aren't true?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think one of the biggest misconceptions is that they're still expensive. Yes, there are EVs at very high price points. But there's actually several models that are coming in below the average purchase price of a new vehicle in the United States, which is about $50,000 these days. On top of that, you have tax credits, which can make them even cheaper. And then, on top of that, you have lower maintenance. So electric vehicles don't need an oil change each year. Actually, through regenerative braking, it's less frequent that you need to do brake pads and brake rotor replacement. No spark plugs to replace every 50,000 miles. So it is already cheaper in many instances to own an electric vehicle than an internal combustion engine when you look at the entire lifetime ownership. So you ought you add all that together. And the economic argument for electric vehicles is really starting to come into the forefront here, which we believe is only going to accelerate adoption. It's not just about is this a better car? Do I like the car? Do I like how it looks? If it is cheaper off the land or cheaper over the lifetime ownership experience? We think that's really going to bring the mass markets into the Evie space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat about Jay, one thing that just come up? Recently, I looked at a company that was trying to find ways to make it easier for Evie owners to be able to charge their vehicles. How about that element? Is the infrastructure going to be there to support getting more electric vehicles on the roads?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's certainly growing. And we've been talking a lot about the Inflation Reduction Act. But another piece of policy in the United States is really accelerating electric charging, which was the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act passed last November. The idea behind that act is to put about seven and a half billion dollars into building 500,000 chargers around the country. So a lot more densification of electric charging. This, in many ways, is basically a subsidy for EV buyers because if there are more chargers and there are faster chargers, in the places that you want to see them. You don't need as big of a battery. And so, if you have a smaller battery, you don't have to pay as much for an electric vehicle. So you can see how different policies from the US government are really trying to accelerate adoption, whether it's tax credits for buyers, whether it's incentives for manufacturers, or building up a charging infrastructure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWith that, I want to thank you, Jay Jacobs, Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares.
