For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations.

Thank you so much for joining us. My name is Julia Rothacker. I'm the director of concierge here at Public. And we're thrilled to be with you today to talk a little bit about the reggae IPO of Shrek music royalties. Keith, would you like to introduce yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey Julia, for those who haven't met me yet? I am Keith Marshall GM of alternatives here at Public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerfect then let's dive straight in. Keith. I know this is a serious investment. But I'm also guessing everybody wants to hear about Shrek.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course. You know, as most of you should already know. Shrek is a bad tempered but good hearted ogre, who goes on a variety of quests in his fairy tale world. So Shrek is just a massive media franchise. It's the 17th highest-grossing film franchise of all time. And the second-highest-grossing animated film franchise which generated over $4 billion in box office sales just wild stats. And interestingly, there's actually a rumored fifth film possibly to be called Shrek Five. And you know as it's grown, the Shrek franchise has just really kept pace with streaming becoming evermore important in this media landscape. So the first two films launched on Netflix in March 2022. And were in the top 10 viewed when they were launched. Another wild stat customers watched 20.8 million Shrek and Shrek Two in the week they launched on Netflix. Those two movies have since shifted over to Peacock, which is obviously the affiliated owner of the Shrek franchise, but some are still visible on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat. And now let's shift a bit to what the investment offering is here. What exactly is a royalty?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, most people actually don't know what royalties are so short answer royalty interests are intellectual property. They're part of the copyright law. So really, the royalties are the actual payments. So the royalties are the payments that come to us from use of this content, the Shrek underlying content, and they're collected by what's known as performing rights organizations basically just like large clearing houses. These PRO's are what actually manage the rights on behalf of rights holders. So royalties are actual payments PRO's their job is to collect these payments from all these underlying sources of content distribution when the music from the Shrek franchise really you know the actual movies are used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks Keith and can you explain what exactly triggers a royalty payment for FRAC?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo this catalogue generates royalties from a bunch of different sources you know, use of the tracks in the movies when the movies are streamed or sold on theme park rides there's a holiday TV special called Shrek The Halls there are even Broadway plays about Shrek all of these different things lead to royalties being generated. And you know, that's it even makes money when the movie I Am Legend plays because Will Smith's character actually watches Shrek during I Am Legend. So a significant portion of these royalty earnings have come from international sources. So this asset actually benefits from not being tied solely to the US market as well. Relatedly there are a ton of references on Reddit videos on YouTube about people actually learning English from watching Shrek, that may be one of the reasons that international viewing is and has been so strong for Shrek. But you know, of course, broadcast and streaming represent the main portion of earnings just because you know the people watching Shrek so a question that's come up a few times from people that I want to clarify. This is the score, not the soundtrack. So Smash Mouth all-star is not included. But like Fairy Tale which some of you may know from recently going viral on TikTok is included. So this is the score just the underlying orchestral music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, I certainly have seen Fairy Tale a lot recently. So that gives a lot of clarity on how Our Shrek royalties work, and I am a big Shrek fan. So I love it. But this is also a an investment. Why would someone invest in royalties?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, as an attorney, we have to present a disclaimer, investors should always do their own research and understand all of these risks to consider before investing. But, you know, stepping back public's goal as a platform is to give investors tools that's investment products, and actually the education as well to build these modern diversified portfolios. And to answer your question, royalties can produce cash flow, which you know, in the current interest rate environment can definitely be appealing to investors. So in the case of the Shrek offering, any royalties received by the entity that holds these royalty interests will be paid out in the form of quarterly dividends. So royalties also benefit from being less correlated with other assets, you know, like Exchange Traded equities, because, again, they're driven by content consumption, not you know, for example, what the stock market is doing going up and down or doesn't, those things don't directly impact how people are watching Shrek and reduce correlation, cashflow. These can help investors lower portfolio volatility and hopefully increase returns on a risk-adjusted basis. So royalties are an investment tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks. And I understand that royalties are actually an established asset class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, so most people don't realize that this really is an investment product. And, you know, to date, institutional investors have just dominated the space is a direct example, the Michigan State employee pension funds have billions of dollars invested in music royalties, and catalogs can just sell for massive amounts, like the recent $225 million sale of Katy Perry's catalogue. You know, most people just can't participate in something like that. So with the Shrek royalties offering, investors can access royalties with as little as a $10 investment. And, you know, most of us don't have hundreds of millions to spend on a single asset, but Public wants to make these public markets actually work for all people. So this offering makes royalties more accessible to everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat makes sense. And why Shrek music within all music royalties,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou know, we talked about the Shrek franchise, and that's actually not the starting point for this thing. First and foremost, it's a mature asset. It has a 20-plus-year earnings history. And while we can't predict performance, you know, that means we're not relying on like how a single song by a single artist has done in the past year to assess what could happen in the next five years. It's also a strong recent historical performance, you know, earnings have actually grown in recent years due in part to streaming. We saw that last year with an earnings bump from Shrek on Netflix. And again, past performance is, of course, no guarantee of future results, but it makes our own analysis more meaningful. So comparing the 2022 calendar year earnings to the offering amount, the asset produced an eight-and-a-half percent return after fees. So it's also a life of rights interest, meaning this royalty interest is valid for the life of the composer Harry Gregson Williams plus seven years and Gregson Williams is 61 As of today. Lastly, it is Shrek we already discussed like it's an awesome media property and you know, Shrek Five could theoretically reinvigorate interest in the rest of the franchise, which could potentially increase royalty earnings. So again, Shrek Five does not yet have a release date. And recent strikes could of course, delay that, but we hope the movie is indeed forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, Keith, last question for you. How does the process work if someone wants to invest?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the offering is $889,700 in total $10 a share, but it can be oversubscribed. So we can actually take in requests for more than the 889k. As of today, the offering is reached about 77% of its total allocation. So it really just you go in the Public app or on our site and you can request shares at the Shrek asset page. After we receive these requests for at least the total offering amount the 889,700 we will process the closing and at that point, investors will be eligible for dividends after the closing. In addition to being eligible for these dividends, investors can participate in a secondary market, meaning they can buy and sell shares from one another on the Public platform. And I want to close out with a reminder that dividend payments aren't guaranteed. They depend directly on the consumption of Shrek to keep generating royalties. So, always do your own research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely. Keith, thank you so much for providing this overview of the Shrek music royalties offering. And thank you all for joining and listening to us. So with that, have a great rest of your day.

So this is 2023. New Year, new time. The last few years, you know just to recap, luxury really skyrocketed during COVID luxury products are the most experiential of all products. And while people were locked in, unable to travel, unable to eat out their lives somewhat constrained, they sought luxury products and a lot of people had additional income because you weren't spending on experiences. So luxury became the new experience. And in fact, the luxury market captured a lot of new consumers. As we ended 2022, there's still you know, in America, there's a lot of pent up demand for travel. We were traveling last year to Europe where you saw lots of luxury purchases transpire in Europe, where in 2021, many of them, and in 2020, they occurred in the US market. The U.S. market took over as the number one market in the last few years where it had been like China are the number one consumers it moved to America. We've seen a lot of shifting happen in the last few years. So as we enter this year, you have a shift back to experiences which consumers want to have, they want to travel and travel has inflationary prices of 25 to 50%. Consumers want to eat out, there's inflation across the board, and the economy is somewhat weakening. So that's one backdrop that's happening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the same time, though, you have the China market opening up. We saw that happen in February. China was really under a lockdown last year so luxury really suffered. So as the Chinese began to travel domestically, and then as this year and next year progressed internationally, they will resume their – we assume they'll resume their love affair with all things luxury. So the big things as we head into this year are the pace of the reopening of China post the pandemic and what was a dampened demand for China for luxury by the Chinese is that resume. And then what's happening in the U.S. economy, there's mounting job losses with the Vigilant fed fighting inflation. The stock market is volatile, and these are factors that impact consumer sentiment and their willingness to spend on discretionary purchases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut as I said, during COVID, we got a lot of new luxury shoppers. It's projected that by 2030, about 75% or more of all luxury purchases will be made by millennials and younger. You have a lot of people that discovered luxury and luxury is sticky. Luxury is better quality. It romances people. It impacts the way people think about themselves. And we believe that they'll be trading down in some more commodity type products, like in the brown beans that you buy, maybe in the jeans that you buy.\u0026nbsp; In apparel, we see a trade down, but luxury we think has stickiness. That said, you know, if you lose your job, you're not going to be buying luxury products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Let's talk about stickiness, mobile, let's also talk about it in the context of pricing. I feel as though there are constantly these articles being published about how Rolex watches Hermes bags, have seen prices skyrocket under the guise of inflation in part but also because demand seems to have gone up from these new demographics. Can you talk about how price sensitive or not luxury is? Not all luxury is created equal if you break it down by category for us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e No, no. So not all luxury is created equal and I mean, the real trick of luxury and really any product category is to best match supply and demand. With luxury you want to have demand outpacing supply. And that's what happened during COVID. More people wanted an Hermes handbag or wanted an Hermes bracelet. Then Hermes was able to meet that demand. Some of it was supply chain constraints, and some of that there were more people entering the market that wanted these things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou also see that in resale if you're a student of the markets, you see that resale has provided pricing transparency into your first purchase. So you could buy a Hermes handbag newer or\u0026nbsp; Louis Vuitton handbag new and see that in the aftermarket, you can get 80 to 150% of what you paid for. So it's brought a new kind of shopper into the market. Also, if you buy in consignment it is where you can often meet that need for a luxury product today. You don't have to wait six months for it. It's In the aftermarket.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNot all products are equal. Certainly Hermes is, you know, unique in its ability to keep consumers panting for demand of you know their Birkin bag or their Kelly bag. But, and you've seen while Gucci was really driving incredible demand through COVID. By the end of COVID. Really, it became.. it was time to move on to another product. So partly as luxury becomes entwined with high priced designer brands, designer design and fashion are different than true luxury.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd let's talk a little bit about where Hermes and LVMH specifically fall on the luxury pricing spectrum. Marie, do you expect the higher end brands like there to be more recession proof than mid tier luxury brands? I mean, as you look at overall demand as distinct printers, price sensitivity, where do you see those learned?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are two different companies. Hermes has this one brand with sub-brands. Birkin is a brand, but it's really one brand, Louis Vuitton is a company that consists of about 80 different luxury brands. So with LVMH you're getting incredible diversification that spans Sephora and beauty, which is our entry points for luxury and in fact is holding up quite well. DFS, which is another part of their selective retail group. But they have some real winners with Louisville Vuitton and Christian Dior and then they have some more fashion brands like a Kenzo that are more vulnerable to an economy than the LDN, then the Louis Vuitton. And then of course, you have Tiffany's, you have all their jewelry lines.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what we saw in 2008 and 2009, is that luxury did not go down as low as other categories and it rebounded more quickly than other consumer discretionary categories. And we think that that will be the case again, this, you know, in this current economic environment, and frankly, this environment is nowhere near what 2008 or 2009 was with the Great Recession. Right now, like we're not even sure if we're in a recession, right? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnne Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, yes. So I think we're not sure if we're in a recession now and it's much more about the outlook. You've talked about Asia demand. Let's call it something else geopolitically that's different today versus in 2008 and that's the impact on Russian demand for luxury goods. Talk to us a little bit about what demand from Russia has looked like in the past and where it stands now, given the conflict with Ukraine?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So Russia, it is not a support as it was in 2008 or2009. Or, you know, it was part of the picture. But now you have a growing UAE, you have a youth that is entering the luxury market. And so I think that, you know, what's different now is there's more people in the market. We recently presented a Shop talk and in 2000, when we entered this century, 3% of the Chinese were in the middle class, by 2018 53% were. I mean, you have a huge middle class of 700 million people that buy luxury. They may buy low, and they have pent up demand from COVID for the last two years. So that's going to help them this year. The UAE has always sought luxury, but now they're bringing it to their own territory and we see a lot of demand coming there, which will offset the loss of the Russian consumer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTalk to us a little bit too, Marie, about direct to consumer and how luxury has been able to sell online, you know, you think about the stereotypical luxury experience, it's very much in person, it's tactile, you see the product, you feel the product, you try the product, if you're paying such high prices, has that evolved?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo their pricing is consistent, you know, the luxury brands are going direct to consumer because they can, they're in selected points of distribution where they want to be often they're renting space in a wonderful department store like a Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue or Bloomingdale's. But going direct to consumer means that you hope that you have control of your messaging at all points, and your adjacencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDuring COVID we saw and we continue to see throughout America, that luxury brands are opening more direct to consumer out physical stores to be where the consumer is because during COVID many consumers moved from metro areas to urban and rural areas. We just did a survey in China and it's more important for the Chinese that they want to discover luxury in physical store locations. And another interesting facet is that they're influenced more by their friends than they are by a KOL. So I urge you folks to check out Coresight’s research and look for our most recent survey on the China luxury consumer. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut so, but direct to consumer is just a way for them to really control what they look like in every point of sale and online. You can get selected products but luxury, is experiential, as you said, and not all the apparel is going to be or the ready to wear, not all the collection is going to be available online. But it's as easy as during COVID the consumers picked up the phone and call their sales associate. And and they were doing one to one selling kind of like one to one live shopping.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, just to finish our conversation, which has been just so interesting. With respect to Hermes and LVMH in particular, can we just go back to something you touched on early, which was the second hand market? We know that both Hermes and LVMH generate about half their revenue from the leather goods category, which is one secondhand market? And then you've got jewelry and others? Can you talk about the second hand appetite for those different product categories?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so I know better the second hand you know, the RealReal's of the world, the best year collective. A lot of it is the leather goods, you know, if you're a shopper and you love luxury goods and you buy some luxury clothing, you see that it drops, unless it's the most iconic of pieces, it drops in value, like 50 to 80%. The handbags hold their value, as I said before, and you get 80 to 150% of what you pay for. The thing about the secondhand market is that you can attract a new consumer to your brand there. A lot of brands, luxury, contemporary are bringing resale on their own branded platform so that they can keep that connection with the consumer. And there's been advances in technology and tagging so that luxury brands can keep track of who owns their product.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll this is to say that secondhand is really very viable. A luxury shopper cares about sustainability. And this secondhand is a feature of sustainability. It shows a prolonged life, it validates a purchase and it validates quality, something that has an extended life. An interesting feature that has come out with the recent RealReal report is that consumers are looking for vintage products and they're looking for handbags that are in fair condition, not necessarily in excellent condition because they want a handbag with the patina of use, which is really interesting. They want to look like they've owned this handbag for 10 years not for you know the last month. Interesting, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat is very interesting.\u0026nbsp; And part of my last question, which comes to mind if you can get your crystal ball out for us, Marie, and look at the next six to 12 months out? How do you see that trend evolving? And what are some other evolving consumer and luxury retail trends you can see coming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I think luxury holds up. I think that, you know, depending on how bad the economy is, you will see an impact. It's more muted in luxury but it you know it does participate in the economy. I think you'll see perhaps people trading into second hand also monetizing what they have in their closet to support their next luxury purchase.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdditionally, beauty will do well. Beauty has become a form of wellness, it's a form of taking care of oneself. So all the and fragrance has become more important in terms of self expression and taking care of oneself. So I think that we're going to see beauty grow, and you see that caring brings beauty in house. So beauty will become a more important feature of overall luxury and luxury will hold up and luxury has less volatile earnings and they can sooner you know, slow down their manufacturing and again keep their supply demand that equation in balance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWith that Marie Driscoll thank you so much for joining us Senior Analyst at Coresight Research.

Welcome, everyone. Welcome to the Alts show. I'm your host, Calum Johnson, and today is a very exciting day. Alts are officially live on Public - over 25 alternative assets that you can choose from and trade in the platform currently. I encourage everyone on the call to check it out. But to help us talk about some of these assets and what this all means, we're joined by Dylan Dittrich and Adam Katz, who heads up research at alternative investment analysis platform Altan Insights, and we also have Leah Smith, who leads acquisitions here on the Public alts team. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe're excited to chat about the offerings that just opened up for trading on Public.com today. Okay, so let's get straight into it. First off, I want to zoom out a bit and start with a general overview. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, Leah, I'm going to send it to you first. Can you quickly just walk us through what we mean when we refer to alts on Public, and why someone would want to consider investing in them? What are some of the risks or so to be aware of?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen we say alternative assets at Public, we mean investments outside of traditional asset classes, like stocks, and cash in our terms, we also mean outside of crypto. The largest categories within alternative investments are typically real estate and private equity. Otis previously focused mostly on cultural assets. So the offerings that you're seeing today on Public are primarily in those kinds of collectible art, sports memorabilia categories. We have every intention of expanding soon, though, in a lot of exciting ways, which I'm sure we will cover at a later date on a different Alts live. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo often people invest in these alternatives because, you know, it's a way of diversifying and also sometimes, you know, peeking into your personal interest. So, ultra-high-net-worth individuals allocate about 5% to collectibles and then larger allotments for real estate and private equity. Many of these categories also perform well against the S\u0026amp;P. The biggest hurdle, you know, in the past was really access. And that's part of why we're so excited to be part of Public now. And again, you know, diversification is the name of the game. That's why a lot of people focus on alts, in general. So, because there are, you know, many categories that perform well against the S\u0026amp;P, there are also risks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn many of these categories, there's less liquidity, there's volatility, and some of the asset categories within the overarching alternative space are even kind of more especially volatile, volatile, like NFTs for example. And then, as with everything, you know, we encourage everyone to do their own research and make sure that the kind of risk-reward profile of your portfolio fits with what you're looking to achieve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks for the context, Leah. I want to open this up and get Adam and Dylan involved here. Obviously, you guys cover this space very, very closely. Could you just give our audience a brief overview of what's been happening broadly in the collectible space? And then, what are some of the big trends and developments that we're seeing at the moment?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDylan, I know you're kind of a regular on the show at this point. Let's start with you, and then We can go to Adam.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, thanks, Calum, thanks for having me back on. So really, in the collectibles and cultural asset worlds, we're coming off of, you know, two years in 2020 and 2021, that we're overall incredibly kind years to collectibles. And that was fueled by a variety of factors, you know, yes, time inside and enduring lockdowns, kind of laid a foundation for nostalgic pursuits and people being reintroduced to collecting habits that had gone dormant. But, you know, as we're learning, perhaps more important than the time inside was really the injection of both fiscal and monetary stimulus into the mainstream investing public, with the government kind of stepping in to backstop the economy, to support the economy. Market participants were very quickly given the confidence to continue to invest and maybe even a rational level of confidence to start speculating financially. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you fast forward to today, and we're in this very different situation where inflation is roaring, and kind of the very firm messaging from the government has been, you know, they're not necessarily stepping in to prevent economic weakness this time around. And so as a result of that, signaling, traditional financial markets, so your stocks and bonds have both kind of been pummeled over the last few months. And that is kind of spreading into many collectible markets, many cultural asset markets, you know, when people start to feel uncertain or uneasy about the economy, they're less inclined to take risks with money. But what's interesting about that, though, is while all that's going on, you know, the whale collectors and investors, the ultra-high net worth individuals, they're impacted a little bit less by this kind of short-term macroeconomic force. So well, collectible markets kind of broadly have been falling, you have still been seeing these huge headlines of multimillion-dollar record sales across asset classes, you know, whether it's sports cards, memorabilia, comic books, there are still huge prices - prices that have never been seen before being paid for the best of the best assets. And that's what makes the idea of democratization of those assets an attractive one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCool. Adam, do you want to come in here as well?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and thanks for having me back. Dylan just gave a really terrific overview of the kind of macro environment over the last couple of years. And just mentioned that at the top of the market, there have been some enormous record-setting sales. The 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle sold for over $12 million, setting a record recently. And what you're seeing beyond just the fact that the top-of-the-top sort of the Grails in collectibles, beyond those performing really well, I would say that the more established categories within collectibles have been outperforming the newer ones.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor people who want to stay in collectibles, that might mean shifting from more speculative modern-day sports cards to vintage sports cards or higher-graded sports cards. And we've seen beyond sports cars memorabilia, things like blue-chip art and wine, which have been in the market for a lot longer than things like video games or NFTs. Those are performed a lot better. And some of them have even gone up even as we've seen the stock market go down. Collectibles are not just one category that acts in concert with each other. There are so many subcategories that have had such different histories that you kind of have to approach them individually. So when you're looking at art or wine, it's going to be different than, as I said, video games or NFTs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, and I think that sets it up really well for our audience. I think a lot of the community on Public is obviously more familiar with stocks. And that's why to both Dylan and Adam - I'm kind of curious to get deeper into the valuing and the pricing of some of these categories. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you kind of just speak about some of the dynamics, some of the influences that kind of gauge how these categories interact and the valuing and the pricing that we see there? Dylan, we can start with you/\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So as you kind of alluded to, you know, with stocks or bonds, they generally have, you know, underlying cash flows or business prospects that make it easier and kind of more tangible to arrive at a valuation. And there's a greater level of assurance and confidence around, you know, kind of the risk involved in the valuation bands into which something could trade – and with collectibles and cultural assets, that's not really the case, right? And so what you're really relying on, to kind of inform value, is the interplay between supply and demand, and how those two forces are shaped and how they can change over time. And, you know, it sounds simple enough kind of at face value, but it's actually pretty, pretty complex. You know, a lot of the very most valuable collectible assets have very low supply, and importantly, that supply isn't likely to grow. But what's so important is recognizing that low supply alone is not enough to make something valuable, right? You need that other component, the demand. When you have kind of this very low, basically, a movable supply, matched with strong demand and the right demand, deep-pocketed demand, that's when you have a recipe for high values. You know, is this the kind of asset that would draw museum-quality collectors? Is it the kind of asset that wouldn't be out of place, you know, headlining an auction successfully at a Sotheby's or Christie's?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd when you think about those two forces, supply and demand, you want to think about, like, what's the time horizon over which you're thinking about those because, you know, if you're short term, and you're looking to make a short term play on an asset, you're looking for, you know, a very sharp uptick in demand and a very short amount of time. Or maybe you're looking to kind of expose an inefficiency in the market where, you know, something is trading at a price that's nowhere near where it would sell at auction or in a private sale. So you're looking for very short-term movement in one of those two forces. When you're long-term, you're thinking about it differently. You're thinking, you know, how does demand change over the course of years or decades? You know, and you start thinking about demographic shifts. You know, who's coming into money or entering their peak earning years? And what do they care about? What are they going to be spending money on? What are they going to be collecting? What kind of inspires nostalgia for them? And is it the same or different from a previous generation? And if it's different, is the market pricing that in yet, and so there's kind of it at face value, very simple kind of framework through which to view these assets, but there's a lot of complex complexity that comes with it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdam, you want to come in here as well?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so I'll just expand on what Dylan just mentioned about nostalgia. I mean, that's a huge driving force in a lot of these asset classes, you know, we're not talking about a rational market with cash flows or, you know, revenue numbers that you can value these assets on, people have very strong connections and emotions to pop culture or sports figures. And it's not just about whether it's a good investment; it's whether they want to own this item. And especially when you're seeing fractionalization of these items and the ability for everyday investors to get pieces of these really special and rare items.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor a lot of people, it's not just about the investment, it's about being able to say that you own a piece of this thing or that you own this whole thing. And just in the first couple hours, that these assets have been live on Public, I've been kind of following the buying and selling and I've just noticed that things like the Pokemon card, the Charizard card and the Harry Potter book, which are square in that demographic of people who are on Public, those things are eliciting strong emotions. And those things have seen a lot of activity so far compared to some of the other assets. So it is about figuring out both what is rare and what has high quality, but it's also trying to understand what the rest of the market is going to desire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then I also just wanted to briefly talk about liquidity. I'm sure you know, Public users who are used to the equities market are used to being able to buy and sell immediately at the market price. You know, there's going to be a lot of buyers and sellers for these things. In collectibles. and in alts. that's not necessarily going to be the case. It's not gonna be the same kind of liquidity you see on the equities markets, and sometimes they're going to be fairly large bid-ask spreads. So it's not just saying, oh, I want to buy this Harry Potter book; it's deciding what you think. It's worth maybe putting a bid in and then having some patience until that gets filled. And similarly, on the sell side, it's the same thing, you might not be able to sell it immediately.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;think that's a really good overview and kind of an insight into the nuances between stocks, and then collectibles and these alternative assets. And I kind of want to go deeper into one of the things you mentioned, which is a great point that when you're evaluating a stock, it's usually based on a business. So you can look at the earnings report, you can look at the revenue numbers, the profit, and different quantifiable metrics. A lot of these alternative asset categories are based around nostalgia and people's emotional attachment, which is just difficult, more difficult to quantify.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm curious, when you guys are writing up a report or researching an asset or doing some of this analysis, what is your process? What kind of metrics and things are you looking at? And are there any specific frameworks that you use to come up with like a determination on the value of an asset? Dylan, we can kick over to you again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, I think, you know, you want to approach an asset through both a short-term and a long-term lens. So, you know, when you're looking at the valuation of an asset today, you want to be wary of things like comparable sales for that asset. Has the same asset or very similar assets, have those been sold at auction recently? And what does the trajectory look like for those sales? You know, have they been trending up, and there's reason to believe that that could continue, and you're not just catching the top? Are they falling, and there's reason to believe that, you know, the slide could be reversed? Or are you, you know, catching a falling knife? And so, you know, looking at very similar sales is part of that from a short-term perspective. But as you're kind of expanding your time horizon, you really want to be thinking about, you know, what are assets that maybe aren't precisely similar but are in some ways comparable, and how are they trading? What does their valuation look like? You know, is it greater than or less than the asset you're studying? And should that be the case based on a variety of factors, like, you know, how rare the asset is, how culturally relevant it is, and how culturally relevant it might be in the future based on demographic trends, and you know, how audiences are growing and falling.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, you know, you really want to kind of both address those kinds of very, very short-term matters to ensure you're getting an evaluation, that's, that's, you know, reasonable in the short term, but also start thinking beyond that, to think, you know, where does this asset go in the next 10 years, and what drives it there, and what brings a bigger audience, for demand to kind of build the, you know, the buyer pool for that type of asset. So, you really want to be able to view it through both of those lenses and be able to kind of extrapolate data across different assets in different asset classes, rely on historical data from other categories to show how different assets of similar stature have risen or fallen over time. That's the way I like to approach it, both from that short-term and that long-term perspective.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, very interesting. Adam, I'm gonna kick it over to you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eComparable sales are often if you find a deer comp, you know, you're looking at a card and the same card and the same gray, same I've just sold, I mean, that's gonna be fairly easy valuation books most the time, unfortunately, not that easy is still instead, you also have to consider the trajectory, you know, the long the short term trend of that player or that type of asset or that artist versus the most recent trend of that asset class as a whole. And whether or not this thing is a true Grail, meaning, you know, one of the top assets within this class, or whether it's not a more run of the mill, because both short-term and long term. In the long-term outlook, what is going to affect demand? Are there going to be catalysts for a greater cultural significance of this item? You know, is this comic book going to be made into a movie? Is this player for this card? Is this person going to be a championship contender? Or if they're retired? Are they going to make the Hall of Fame? You know, are there discrete events that could potentially push this item into the public eye, which then will increase demand probably more short term than long term? But surely, you will see things like I just mentioned that will boost demand and, therefore, boost prices for things canceled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, great. And I think it's, I think it's an interesting point about how events and these kinds of landmark moments can also influence value and pricing. I know even back a couple of years ago when the last dance documentary came out about Jordan, we kind of saw a rise in value in some of his memorabilia and trading cards. So I think it's definitely an interesting thing for people to keep in mind. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeah, I want to bring you back in here because I know that you obviously do a ton of research and analysis when you're making acquisitions for Public for the Alts team; how, what is, what is your process? And then, I guess, how does it differ, if at all, from some of the things that Dylan and Adam explained from how they do things?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo everything that both Dylan Dylan and Adam have mentioned, we definitely look at it, I think it's a lot about, you know, category and subcategory-specific context. So if we're looking at cards, we take into account, obviously, you know, comparable sales and grading and pop reports. And then there are the added layers of some of the more qualitative stuff like, you know, or not even necessarily qualitative, but who's the player? What's their legacy? Or if it's a newer player, what are their projections?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's everything that Dylan and Adam have mentioned, with the additional kind of layer of not just kind of broad demand. So in that way, it's different than, you know, finding a singular buyer at an auction in that kind of analysis that goes into something like that. And more, you know, is this going to resonate with, with a larger group of people who, who is this going to be most relevant for? So I think, you know, I think it was Dylan's point who said that there were a couple of the assets that have migrated over today that have seen, you know, some significant activity. And because, I would agree, you know, that it's squarely in that sort of demographic. So I would say that we.. the added layer of considering who we would be making this acquisition for which audience is a really important one that we, you know, bake into our analysis after we do all of the normal kind of investment analysis.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, that's really, that's really helpful. context. And, you know, I think because, obviously, alts have launched today, one thing I definitely wanted to get all of your take on was, and we can go around the room with this, what is kind of your favorite asset that you're looking at right now, and you're excited about? Obviously putting it out there that this is not investment advice for anyone that's in the audience. But yeah, I would love to hear some of the assets you guys are excited about that have launched today. Dylan, we can start with you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNice. Yeah. So I'm a sneaker guy at heart. So I've always been intrigued by the Shattered Backboard Air Jordan 1 on the platform. So a little quick, quick backstory - this is the sneaker Michael Jordan wore, Air Jordan 1, when he was playing an exhibition game over in Italy. He went up to dunk and shattered the backboard, effectively ending the game. And these are the sneakers from that exact moment. I think there's even glass in the soul of the sneaker. At one point, this was the single most expensive pair of sneakers ever sold at auction when it sold n August 2020 for $615,000.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eInterestingly enough, some of the Public investors have beaten me to the punch on this one. This was one of the assets that popped higher today. I think the market cap is somewhere in the neighborhood of where it sold at auction two years ago. But it's interesting, I mean, right now, you have huge headline sales in blue chip game Warren memorabilia. Michael Jordan's jersey from game one of the 1998 finals just sold two weeks ago for $10.1 million. So you know, you can see there is increased demand for a worn pair of Jordan 1s that have really strong provenance that's photo matched. And, you know, that alone would make this asset cool. But the fact is, it also inspired that moment, inspired one of the most kind of iconic Jordan colorways, the Shattered Backboard colorway, which is white, orange, and black and nods to the uniform that Jordan was wearing that day. So it's a colorway Nike is still using all the time and nodding to across different models. So just a really cool asset. And I think not investment advice, but definitely, a cool one to see democratized in this way.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVery cool. And I love that one as well. Adam, do you want to step in here? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. I have shares in a few of these assets as well, so I won't mention any of those. But I'm excited about them. One thing that kept an eye on for a long time, Mr. Wiley, is one of my favorite artists in speaking of, you know, emotional connection, personal connection, nostalgia, I would love to own a fork in him no Wiley painting at some point in my life. But for now, you know, the ability to have access to get shares of that is pretty incredible. Artwork is something that doesn't get as much attention. But I think it's great that there are those options on Public because it has been an asset class with a long history and a long history of performing really well, and honestly, I'd love to see more work on the platform.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, amazing. And Leah, I like that we have one sneaker, we have one pair of art, Leah, I'm going to let you kind of round it out, finish it off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so again, this is not investment advice. And this is coming from somebody who's been sometimes very, very close, literally, physically, to the assets themselves. So, you know, I would say I am on the complete same page with Adam and Dylan for those two assets. But one of my personal favorites is Harry Potter. It's just such a huge cornerstone story for an entire generation. And that generation is also, you know, having kids, and I think that first book, getting to see it in person, even myself, It was so exciting, and it's just a really important asset. I think it has launched, you know, multiple generations now of readers and a huge media franchise, and I think it's just a, it's a really great example of the book as well. So that's mine always.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLeah, just on that, before I get to the final question, can you give a bit more of the context around that asset? I know that there were only about 500 copies of that first edition book. And there's kind of an interesting, just context around why that specific book is so special.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So I think a lot of people know, but if you don't, you know, JK Rowling had a hard time finding a publisher initially for Harry Potter and that story. And so there was a publisher out of London called Bloomsbury that took a risk and printed 500 books, about half of which went to libraries and the other half of which went to bookstores. There are a couple of typos, including one on the back cover, I want to say if memory serves. And this is, being that it's already a really, really limited supply of 500 and being that half of those, you know, went to libraries, the chances of any of those books surviving in readable condition are relatively slim.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut as far as context goes, there are just enough that you know, every once in a while, you'll see something come to auction. So in a lot of ways, it's almost like a perfect example asset for us just because there's just enough context to undo or stand, you know, pricing and comps and things like that. But it also is just so culturally, hugely relevant. And there's no more of those first 500 ever coming out again or being printed again. So that's why I think it's such an interesting asset that checks a lot of boxes for us.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eReally cool. And I think it just goes to serve how there are such interesting stories behind each of these individual assets. Okay, so here's where I want to end with the final question. Today, we've obviously launched with collectibles, NFTs, and fine art. I know that we're planning to bring more kind of asset categories to the platform and give people even more exposure and opportunity to diversify their portfolios.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI want to go around the room here. Are there any kind of asset categories that you have in mind that you would be very excited for Public to potentially bring on the platform? Maybe if it's not asset categories, it's a specific asset? Just kind of interested to get your guys' thoughts on that. And Dylan, I'll kick it back over to you to start.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, I think they're, they're kind of two audiences, two fan bases that are somewhat underrepresented in the, in the collectibles world. So I'd definitely be interested to see either some movie memorabilia or music memorabilia introduced to the platform. There have been some really cool pieces that have shown up at auction over the years of, you know, handwritten lyrics to iconic songs that draw, you know, high six-figure, low seven-figure sums. And they're really cool relics that kind of show that artistic process and the evolution of something that goes on to become very celebrated and very famous. And, you know, I think music fan bases, music audiences are very passionate and very engaged. So always game to see those kinds of things more represented fractionally as well.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, awesome - those are two really cool ones. Adam, do you also want to come in here as well?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, totally agree with Dylan. I think that those would be super cool asset classes to add. For me, I am definitely interested in seeing wine and spirits. People have been investing in wine for a long table, and it has historically been a relatively stable asset class in a lot of ways than some of the others that are represented on the platform already. I also think that it appeals to a different kind of user than some of the assets that are there already. And I think that there are a lot of really awesome high-end whiskies that have been selling recently at auction. And I would love to see some of that on there. And for a more specific asset, if you could get that Aaron Judge 62nd home run, if and when that happens. I mean, that would be pretty awesome.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's it. That's a big one. Leah, do you want to finish it off?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, we actually do have an offer out on the final judge, home run, but I know that there's a 2 million offer right now on the 62. So we're on the same page, Adam, hopefully, one day we'll get there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think, you know, part of me is a little torn because I don't want to give away too much of, you know, some exciting stuff that's to come. But I think there's so much exciting stuff around movie and music, memorabilia, wine and spirits too, of course, but I think within income generating alternatives too, that's where I'd also be really excited to bring some stuff to Public members to be able to invest in and, and kind of, you know, grow and play along with. So I don't want to give away too much, but I do want to say that there's a lot of expansion coming, and it's all really exciting. I'm biased, obviously. But I think there's a lot of fun stuff on the horizon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, for sure. And I'm definitely inclined to agree. I think the cash-flowing, cash-generating assets are really interesting, like the royalties, the real estate, all of that. But yeah, it's been an amazing show. Thank you. Thank you to all our guests for coming on and giving that breakdown in that context.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["ALTS"],"sponsorDetailsDto":null,"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"d0b2d87d-5846-4b13-800d-7b9e62c33559","username":"calumjohnson1","displayName":"Calum Johnson","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/kUJQinOxEGImVVSsF17ud352BcYVJvTT-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"Marketing Manager at Public|Host of the Public Live Alts Show\n|All opinions are my own, not investment advice","followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"923b27b7-1c24-484a-8817-ccd8dfb7bed9","username":"leahalts","displayName":"Leah Smith","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/FrtxHePMAFuQTZUt7aNkO9g58sIJlKRe-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":null,"followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"1d0da544-2faf-479c-80b0-18d1fa1289cd","username":"adamkatz","displayName":"Adam Katz","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/53n9JuDpO1VRSCLV5atTSM8ChhFVGLLX-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"Adam Katz (@AdamKatzWriter) is the Head of Research for Vincent.

Welcome to Alts, my name is Calum and I’m your host. This show is all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture and investing. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have a very exciting show today because we're going to be giving you a bit of a preview of how alts investing is going to work on Public. So to be clear, alts won't be launching until later this month, on Public, but we thought it made sense to start educating our community on the details of how these new assets work on the public platform. Because it's quite a new product that differs in many ways from stocks and crypto, that you're all familiar with. So to that end, we've brought in Keith Marshall, who leads the alts team here at Public to break down everything for us. Keith, welcome to the show. Can you give the audience a quick introduction into who you are, and then how you got into alts?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, thing. Thanks, Calum. Great to meet everyone. I'm Keith Marshall, the GM of the Alts team here at Public. I'm an attorney by trade and was the General Counsel at Otis, which I'll talk more about in a minute. I also happen to personally love all things alts though from art, to wine to NFTs and pretty much anything in this category. I've collected wine and art for years now. The wine collection is small, and I mostly enjoyed drinking it, but that's beside the fact. On the NFT side, I've been playing around for about two years now and I'm pretty deep in crypto as well. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can and do talk about this stuff literally all day. So I'll do my best to keep these responses to the point as best I can. I mentioned Otis, though, as a reminder for everyone, Public acquired Otis earlier this year. And it's an incredibly exciting new chapter for us where we're basically taking the vision of Otis and bringing alts to a much larger audience here at Public. The acquisition is overall part of Public’s strategy to redefine the modern portfolio and make public markets work for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, amazing. Thanks for the intro. I want to start here and just with understanding the assets themselves, and what the Public community will actually be able to invest in. So when we talk about alternative assets on Public, can you just give us a bit more detail? What type of assets are we specifically talking about?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as a category, stepping back, alternative assets generally refers to anything besides extreme exchange listed stocks, ETFs, bonds, cash and sometimes crypto. On Public specifically, though, alts is a much narrower subset. They are securities that represent fractional ownership of assets like art, collectibles, and NFTs. Broadly, we call them cultural assets. Over time, though, the goal is to broaden our categories available for investment to include a much more diverse selection of alts on Public. We plan to look at things that produce cash flows, like music, royalties, real estate, we might even do things like private equity and venture capital. But again, a super important reminder on Public, these are actually interests in a legal entity that owns an asset, not the assets themselves, like you might see on Stock X.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSuper cool, and especially when we start talking about real estate and music royalties, I think it really gets cool, and it gets very exciting. I want to take it even a step further back. Why would people potentially be interested in investing in these types of assets? Why should they make it part of their portfolios?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo alternative assets are increasingly becoming part of a modern diversified investment portfolio. Historically, this has mostly been led by high net worth individuals, even back to a 2020 survey shows that they allocate around 5% to collectibles alone, and even bigger numbers to private equity and real estate. So our goal is to bring some of these assets to a much broader group of people, not just that super small .01, .1% of the population. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the reason for this is that alt assets have historically performed pretty well over time as compared to the S\u0026amp;P. The lawyer in me is screaming past performance is not indicative of future results. Sorry, had to say that, but timing is everything here. Anyway, there are a growing number of sources too, that just point to certain alternative assets having really low correlation with traditional asset classes, meaning they're again part of a diversified investment portfolio, and some can even be seen as a hedge against inflation, partially through diversifying your portfolio. TLDR - you should never put all of your eggs in one basket and alts are a different type of egg that you can put in your basket If it fits for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, perfect. And I love that you always have the lawyer hotline as well. I'm curious from a legal standpoint, how did these once these assets are acquired? How do they actually become investable shares that are then accessible to the public community.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe term fractionalization is thrown around pretty frequently. But the concept really means for us holding an asset in a legal entity. So to start, we're identifying and potentially securing or purchasing a specific asset or group of assets that can be outright purchase, consignment, or even just identifying a broad category like floor Bored Ape NFTs. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe then form a Delaware entity to eventually hold the asset. After that asset is identified, we form a company, then we file a document, really a set of documents with the SEC, that will, with SEC approval, allow that company to offer securities representing this fractional ownership of the asset. These offering documents are incredibly robust include pages and pages of risk factors and things about the investment itself and investing in alts generally. So you've got this document that describes the entity, describes the asset. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third piece is the financials, because these are again, separate companies. So each eventually gets its own set of audited financial statements. And there's even a confirmation by an independent auditor, that we actually hold the asset we say we hold. And it's worth mentioning that you may have read about fractionalization through NFTs, for example, like buying an NF t that represents a fractional portion of the trading card. This is not what we're doing. I would strongly caution investors to do a ton of research, because those particular assets might not be going through the U.S. securities law framework, which adds a huge layer of risk. Instead, we're going with a more tried and true path that has the SEC putting their eyes on things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat - and I definitely echo that. Always do your research before you get involved with anything like this. I want to step into the shoes of the Public member who's considering potentially investing in an alt when they become available on Public. I'm curious - so when you invest in an alt on Public, what is it that you're actually investing or buying shares into? Can you just give a bit more detail on that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, it's a similar concept to buying a share of Tesla or Apple or Google, except that it happens to be a legal entity tied to a specific asset. So as I mentioned before, you're buying securities that represent a fractional interest in a given asset, not the asset itself. In our current structure, you are technically becoming the holder of membership interests in a limited liability company. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor ease, I'll call the shares and the company I'll refer to interchangeably as an asset, mostly because aside from me, most people think of the underlying asset, like Shattered Backboard sneakers, not the name of the legal entity. So the sole purpose of that legal entity is to hold this actual asset. And to drive this point home as best I can, a great example is you can't exchange the shares you hold for the asset itself, you are literally holding a legal interest in the entity that holds the asset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, perfect. And thank you for that context. I know, even when we were at Otis, and now coming over to Public and alts coming to Public, a big discussion is around liquidity around alts. So can you just give the audience and everyone a refresher on, first of all, what is liquidity? And then why is it important to think about liquidity when it comes to investing in alts on Public?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I'll step back even higher at first. I mean, the main point of the acquisition of Otis by Public was to increase liquidity overall for the specific asset classes. So liquidity is basically the speed and ease with which you can exit a given investment. Basically, how can you get the cash value of your investment? Or what is your ability to convert the shares you hold back to cash quickly and at a price that's acceptable to you? We generally talk about liquidity from the sellers perspective, although of course liquidity affects buyers as well because it means there needs to be liquidity for you to actually buy something and enter a position. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo an asset like an exchange listed stock, like a Tesla, or Google that you'd find on NASDAQ, or the New York Stock Exchange, those are highly liquid. Those are large markets with tons of participants, all across different platforms. Conversely, you have assets like private equity interests, they're highly illiquid. There's generally no market for investments like that, and you may not even have a means to sell them outside of the fund being wound down, for example. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo for alts on Public, the market is limited to Public itself, meaning members of Public are buying and selling amongst each other. This is really different from exchange listed stocks, and even crypto where there are marketplaces outside of the public ecosystem. This means that, you know, alts on Public are going to have lower liquidity than traditional exchange listed stocks. But again, the hope is for Public to make these asset classes substantially more liquid than before, and bring these markets to a much more mature level than they are today. On an asset by asset basis, you'll also see varying levels of liquidity, depending on public members willingness to buy or sell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, perfect. And I think, to your point, it's something that's very important for Public members to consider when they're investing in alts is, does the liquidity fit with the time horizon and their investment goals? That's something to consider before you get into it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, great. So we've kind of covered the big picture things. I'd love to get more into the nitty gritty logistics of how Public members will actually be able to buy and sell shares and these assets on the app. So could you kind of just give us an overview of the different stages of the investing process into alts?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor sure. So first, there's an initial offering, which I briefly mentioned before - at that stage, you are purchasing shares directly from this company that holds the asset, there's one price and a set number of shares are sold at this given price. Then we go through a four to six week administrative closing period, where we take all of the investments in the initial offering, tick and tie everything together, and officially close it in air quotes. So the securities at that point, can be bought and sold between public members in trading. And trading between public members just means that people are literally buying and selling amongst each other. This is what we will be launching very, very soon in the next few weeks. Initial offerings will happen on the Public platform, hopefully later this year or early next year.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, nice. So you really alluded to it, but just to make it clear for everyone, the first alts that are offered on Public are not going to go through the initial offering process, but going to open directly for trading.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eKeith, can you kind of just explain some of the thinking behind why that is?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely - and great point to drill down here. Each asset that's going to be available for trading already went through the initial offering process on Otis. So basically, that initial first piece, the initial offering, has already happened in the past dating back to 2019 for the earliest, and is now being brought over to Public from the Otis ecosystem. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo on day one, any shares that are available to purchase are basically owned by individuals who invested through the oldest platform. Since this will be trading, not initial offerings, prices won't be fixed and can honestly vary minute by minute. One other important thing to note here, we're actually in discussions to bring similar third party assets to the platform for trading, which would be pretty exciting to again, add to the diversity of offerings on the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, amazing. Since the trading process, I think it's a bit different than what you see with stocks and crypto, I think that experience will be slightly different for users. Let's really kind of drill down more into it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo at a high level, can you kind of just explain how will members use the app to buy and sell shares in alts?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe overall experience is similar to exchange listed stocks and crypto especially if you've traded crypto on an exchange before. The big difference being members are buying directly from each other, which again affects liquidity. The experience itself will have some slight nuances, though mostly tailored to these being slightly different types of securities. So to start, you enter an order to buy or sell. You're going to put in the price you'd like to pay or receive, and the quantity you'd like to buy or sell. If that price is agreeable to someone who wants to put in a matching, buy or sell, the trade clears cash and shares change hands, and everyone is hopefully happy. If there's no match, like if your price is too high or too low, the order will stay on the order book, and basically not be cleared. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo an example is like, let's say I want to buy a share for 1 cent, no one's willing to sell for 1 cent, my order stays on the order book. This process is actually what happens with traditional stock market exchange listed securities too, you just don't notice it, because the volume of orders in that market is so much higher. And it's similar, though still, because just because you want to buy Tesla for $1 doesn't mean anyone else is willing to sell at that price. So the difference here is that with this limited liquidity, you may or may not be able to buy or sell the quantity you want at the specific price you want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, Keith so I'm going to throw a bit of an alternative scenario your way and you can tell me what would happen in this case. So what happens if, for instance, a bid price that's higher than any of the ask prices is higher than any of the ask prices on the book? What would happen in that scenario? How would it be made?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo it is a traditional limit order book, but we have what's called best price execution. So rephrasing, you put in the highest price you're willing to buy, or the lowest price you're willing to sell plus a quantity. That doesn't mean it actually executes at that price, though. So say, for example, that someone's willing to sell one share for $100 and ask.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you're actually willing to purchase for up to $125, and put in a bid for $125, you'll still get the best price, meaning the trade actually clears at that $100 that someone is willing to sell, not the $125 that you'd be willing to pay. Put differently, again, prices don't have to match exactly, they just have to cross. That's what limit order means. It's the max limit in which you're willing to buy in the min limit you're willing to sell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, nice. So so taking all of that and that nuance, how does that translate into some of the ways that a Public member can use the information that they're seeing on the order book, when thinking about an asset they want to invest in?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe ability to buy and sell depends on both price and quantity. So it really goes to your goals and specific timing needs. If you want to buy or sell immediately, you need to look at the order book and say, am I willing to transact at the price that's readily available? Because basically, you need to match an order that's already in the order book. And even then you might not get the quantity you want. So a concrete example, say you really want to buy one share of the Shattered Backboard game worn Jordan sneakers. There's an ask for one share on the order book for $10. That might not be the best price, for example, the last share might have sold for $7, but you could buy it immediately for $10, and you might do so if you wanted to buy 10 shares, you could still only get one share at that $10 price sale. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the order book plays in here by giving you kind of a live view and how other people are willing to transact. And alongside that, transaction history helps you see where people are actually transacting. If instead, your goals are a little different, you don't need to buy or sell immediately and are more focused on price, then you can use the order book to gauge demand for the given price. So for example, let's say most people are selling at $10, you're only willing to sell for $100, so it’s probably fairly unlikely there's going to be a willing buyer, given that everyone else is willing to sell at $10. The same would be the case on the flip side, if for example everyone's selling at $10 and you're only willing to pay $1. There's just not going to be enough liquidity at the given price and quantity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, great. No thanks, Keith, for explaining all of that. I think that's really helpful information. And for everyone in the audience,I know that we're throwing quite a lot of information your way. There will be an FAQ available on alts, which will kind of explain everything and reiterate everything that Keith has said and mentioned in this episode. We’ll also be doing a second Public life in a couple of weeks, which will be giving everyone more of an intro into the assets themselves, so that will be opening on Public for trading initially. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I would like to talk a little bit about some of the behind the scenes regarding the actual assets themselves from acquisition to how they're handled. So Keith, maybe we can start here, which is, first off, how does Public even acquire these assets in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo it's easy to get super bogged down into securities and trading and all that stuff. This side is the fun part. And what's really exciting in our business, and it's really, because high quality alternative assets are just difficult for most people to access. And it's mostly because of price and also scarcity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTaking wine as an example, some of the best wines, it might be $100,000, or more for a single case of wine. For great art, it can be over a million. That's things that normal people really just can't access at all, even if you can find one, you probably can't afford it. And one of the main functions of the alts team here at Public is this platform supply, which is run by my colleague Leah. So we work with a network of collectors, auction houses, galleries, and different providers in various categories to find these specific assets, and vet the quality. So we're also looking to work with partners that hold assets already or have deep expertise in a specific category, like wine or real estate being two good examples.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and I think to your point, it's one of the really cool aspects about what we're doing, which is making these assets which could potentially be worthwhile investments for people. Of course, that's not investing advice, making them accessible to a wide variety of people. You kind of spoke about the acquisitions, how that's the fun part of what we do. What does Public look for when we're considering assets for potential acquisition?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe generally look at a category by category level, and look for things with established collector bases, strong sales history, that typical stuff like art, wine trading cards, comic books, luxury handbags, video games, even sneakers. Basically, there's an existing market for them and data to back up sales in that market. So the key point being public sales data, because this is super helpful for us as we look to gauge pricing and these assets we're looking at. And we're usually evaluating for three particular things: cultural significance, scarcity, and price. And these are all generally important for return potential, returns, of course, number being guaranteed, but there's varying parts to them that affect price. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo a great example is the shattered backward sneakers that I mentioned, which were game worn by Michael Jordan. They actually embody all three of those really well, because the shoes represent a very iconic moment in sports history, when Jordan shattered the backboard from a dunk during an exhibition game in Italy. And there's even a piece of the glass embedded in the shoe still, which is just super cool. So there's your cultural significance. It's a key moment in sports history. This also happens to mean there's built in scarcity. It's a one and only asset because Jordan wore these shoes during the game. The downside to that and incredibly high scarcity is they can make price determination tougher. Scarce, your assets, of course, tend to command higher prices so it is a very key factor. This asset, though, again, benefited from a prior auction sale. So we actually had a market driven price on which we can base our acquisition, because we never want to overpay for an asset, because that'll affect investors returns if we eventually do sell a specific asset. So all three factors play into whether something is a fit for our platform as a whole. Again, by no means should this be considered a recommendation to invest in any of these or the Shattered Backboard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, I think that's great context. And I think it's also helpful even just seeing it behind the scenes, how rigorous that process is of evaluating whether an asset would be a good acquisition. Let's go and talk about what happens post acquisition. So can you kind of just go into a bit more detail about how the physical assets are managed after they've been acquired?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCondition is absolutely critical for these assets. So we take asset management incredibly seriously. And we're not just throwing these things in a corner of the office, there's incredibly robust protocols for what we're doing with these. Physical assets are securely shipped to specialized storage facilities that know how to deal with these things. So for trading cards, that's PwCC in Oregon. For other assets, like art and sneakers, that's Uovo, which is a fine art storage facility, with a location on Long Island City that we use. And each has their own security protocols, temperature and humidity controls, trained staff members, it's basically the full package to make sure that these assets are kept as best they should. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur physical assets are also covered by insurance during transit and placed in storage facilities. So we're taking steps to make sure they're safeguarded in real life. And in terms of value. Intangible assets, like NFTs differ slightly. In part, there are no insurance products available yet for some of them. But we do use industry practices such as you know, using a multifactor Gnosis safe to hold NFTs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, nice. And I think once you once even you keep talking about the process that we go through in the research that we do, to first acquire the assets, and then everything that happens around storing, and the logistics and the insurance of the assets, you start to see why investing in these sorts of things, has historically been quite inaccessible, which I think is why it's why it's so powerful and why it's so cool what we're going to be able to do here. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore I get to the final question, just a reminder for everyone in the audience, there will be an FAQ, once alts are launched, which kind of explains and reiterates everything that Keith has said. So no worries if you've missed it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, so on the final point, I understand that every asset also comes with a document called the “offering circular.” Can you just explain to the audience? What is the point of offering circulars, and why might an investor want to read them?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So the offering circulars is an investor's best resource. And it's the foundation for diligence in one of these investments. The offering circle is actually part of the initial offering process, so it's the main thing that gets filed with the SEC. But the info is still relevant for those participating only in trading because it describes the legal entity, the asset itself, and even the management of the asset. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe offering circular is basically a very long document that details all sorts of information, you might need to know about the company, the asset, Public itself, how we deal with the asset, how we store the asset, what our insurance protocols are, and most importantly, providing a substantial list of risk factors that describe things that could affect your investment in an asset like this. So it's a really important document to review if you're considering investment, and we provide links in app to the offering circulars for particular assets. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing I'd like to call out those, these are point in time documents - they're made for the initial offering. So we do file periodic updates on the SEC EDGAR website, along with these up to date financial statements like semi annual unaudited financial statements, and audited annual financial statements. So there's additional information available online.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so definitely encourage everyone to take a look at one of those. Thank you so much, Keith, for joining us on the show today, your first alts show. I’m sure there'll be a few more. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, for everyone in the audience. The big thing to remember is that alts will be coming very soon, later this month on Public, so keep an eye out there. We're really excited to be bringing these assets to everyone and allowing everyone to start investing in everything. Thank you, everyone for joining us today. Have a good one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["ALTS"],"sponsorDetailsDto":null,"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"60d8add1-1fb3-4d33-9778-b7d8e682b55b","username":"keithmarshall","displayName":"Keith Marshall","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/1yEN8T0kOqrTEUKTLaNoCDyIN4rrFXxu-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":null,"followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"d0b2d87d-5846-4b13-800d-7b9e62c33559","username":"calumjohnson1","displayName":"Calum Johnson","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/kUJQinOxEGImVVSsF17ud352BcYVJvTT-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"Marketing Manager at Public|Host of the Public Live Alts Show\n|All opinions are my own, not investment advice","followedByMe":false,"following":false}],"stocks":[],"slug":"https://app.public.com/live/alternative-assets/introduction-to-alternative-investing","uniqueId":"QaZfJzTtbwOAmGB0FqSHomUEWD3znwGM","status":"PUBLISHED","linkedIds":["EnhFZQZ3CDGIjC17tdsF9seSeCzcFndz"],"cta":{"buttonText":"Sign up","title":"Introduction to Alternative Investing","subtitle":"Invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptos, alts, and more.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture and investing. I'm your host, Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Before we get into it, let's get the energy in the room up. Let's hit that like button. We've got a really exciting episode for you guys with some great guests. So let's get into that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we are joined by Dylan and Bradley from Altan insights, the leading platform for alternative asset investing, intelligence and analysis. Dylan and Bradley will be sharing some of the biggest findings from their latest research on the sports collectibles market covering both sports cards and memorabilia. Since we're going to be talking about so many current events and what's happening in these markets, at the moment through the report, and there's a lot to get through, we're going to skip the five and five and jump directly into it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo without further ado, let me hand it over to the guests. Dylan, Bradley, could you quickly reintroduce yourself to the audience? I know you've come on Public live a few times. Introduce yourself and Altan insights. Give us a bit of an overview of the new report that you've just released about sports collectibles in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. Thanks, Calum and thanks for having us back. My name is Dylan Dittrich, and I kind of lead the research effort at Altan Insights. And what Altan really focuses on is kind of empowering and arming the modern investor to explore alternative asset classes. Specifically, we look at collectible asset classes, things like fine art, wine, sports collectibles, classic cars. And so providing research analysis and data to kind of dig deeper into those asset classes, understand how they perform and understand the different kinds of forces that drive them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so as part of that effort on a quarterly basis, we put out a report on the state of the sports collectibles market, how sports cards are performing, how sports memorabilia is performing, you know, what are the different trends in different sports? How are collectors and investors approaching these categories? So I certainly would encourage everybody to visit the site and download the report if you're interested and have the time - but it was certainly an interesting second quarter to chronicle. Much like other assets that can be more speculative in nature, sports collectibles were challenged in some pockets, but had some really kind of interesting and even encouraging things happening in others. So looking forward to kind of diving into those with you guys today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd I'll just second Dylan. Thank you for having me on. I'm with Altan Insights as well. I do research alongside Dylan. I worked on the sports collectibles report that we put out recently in the first and second quarters as well as our art report and I’m also a qualified appraiser with the International Society of appraisers covering art, collectibles and memorabilia. So I've always had a big interest in the valuations of these assets, following them as actual investable vehicles and just tracking the data and the performance records everything that you can see in our reports on a quarterly basis, and you know, just putting out the research that we do looking at the sales and kind of going beyond just the numbers, so thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, great. Thank you both for the introduction. I want to get straight into the report. So like, what have we learned about the sports collectibles market in Q2? And I want to take kind of one of the big points that you made in that report, which was, are we seeing a healthy reset of the market away from speculation, or has a paradigm shift occurred that will change the way these markets perform going forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think just to zoom out a little bit, like some other categories of when, when the pandemic hit, kind of fueled by nostalgia fueled by stimulus checks, fueled by more time at home, sports collectibles really started to soar. So sports cards in particular, as people kind of, you know, revisited old treasures that might have been in the basement or the attic, and kind of revisited hobbies from their past. And it just brought a huge new audience into this space. And with that new demand came, you know, very rapid appreciation in these categories. And, as was the case, in other categories that saw similarly heightened demand over the last few years, the second quarter of 2022, was was challenging, as people became kind of skittish about the state of the economy, skittish about, you know, traditional financial markets, they were relatively eager and willing to sell these assets. And in many cases, that led to, you know, significant kind of declines in value across many different categories within the sports collectible space. And so I think a part of that is, is very likely a healthy reset of perhaps some things that had run a little bit too high, too fast.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think it's also important to add the caveat that, you know, it seems kind of indisputable that since before the last few years, the audience has definitely grown for the long term. And so, you know, we'd still expect to see there, you know, be more interested in this space than there was previously. But you know, when there's economic economic turmoil, when there's traditional financial market turmoil, it's not uncommon to see speculative assets like these sell off, even though that hasn't necessarily always been the case in sports collectibles. You know, historically, in other moments of financial crisis, economic crisis 2008, 2009, for example, you know, there are indices that suggest that sports cards didn't sell off that much. But, you know, we live in a very different kind of market today where people can basically sell cards that at a moment's notice, you know, friction is much lower than it has been in the past. And so when kind of investor and collector sentiment turns, you know, people can act on that, and so very easily nowadays and, and I think that played a role in sending some valuations lower in q2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eBradley, did you want to jump in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eI second Dylan on that. And also say that while we saw those pullbacks within the broader market, and I'm sure we'll touch on the upper end of the market, it continued to hold up well, which is something we haven't seen tested over the last few years, right. These are markets that have been tracked in some cases for decades now, and to see the broader market pull back rather significantly, and in some cases, well beyond even just a traditional stock market or other asset classes, but then to also simultaneously see the highest end of the card market your your blue chip type cards and memorabilia, seeing record prices, and in some cases, the auctions seeing heightened volume, more bidders, an increase in bids on high end cards definitely showed just a shift almost, when you look at a traditional market, that movement from maybe growth to value that you see sometimes in downturns. So it's certainly some things that we see across other markets are being replicated in sports collectibles as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. And just as a point for both of you, definitely feel free to just jump in whenever you want. We want to be as much of a conversation as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think you both made some great points. Dylan, I wanted to pick up on one thing you mentioned, which is the sports card market today, there's a lot less friction when it comes to access to liquidity. Could you go a bit deeper into that like, versus what we've seen historically, what are some of the factors that have caused there to be a lot less friction in the market, it's a lot easier for people to, like exit their position. Is that auctions? Is that the fractional markets? What are some of those factors that have caused that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think when you think about all of this new demand that's come into the space, you know, with that comes investment dollars and the pursuit of innovation, to make things, you know, easier on that new demand to make it easier for them to transact. And so I think a lot of the leading platforms in the space, whether you're talking about auction houses, whether you're talking about marketplaces, the technology that they're using has advanced considerably. The marketing around auctions has increased considerably, the frequency of auctions has increased considerably. And there's also a lot of, you know, competition to be the venue where people are buying and selling sports collectibles, and so that has the power to lower costs as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so, whereas, you know, in decades prior, somebody might move to sell a card, and they might have to wait, you know, a month or two for the next auction, or they had to, you know, create their own eBay listing and kind of wait for that to be completed, it's really a lot easier today and it takes a lot less kind of manual legwork. And there are many platforms, you know, kind of designed to make buying and selling these things akin to buying and selling stocks. And we see that with fractional platforms as well. And so there's definitely an increased focus on liquidity, which is great, that means you can convert your asset to cash in a shorter amount of time and with greater ease. But on the flip side of that, that means that, you know, a market and valuations and price levels can react a whole lot faster when people start getting a bit nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think it's such an interesting point that like the reduction in friction, means that from a psychological point of view, investors in sports cards can now act a lot more similar to how, you know, investors in more traditional assets, like stocks can behave.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I think, you know, to use an example from a more traditional asset class, you know, you know, the performance of asset classes, like private equity and private real estate, are always touted as being quite strong on a risk adjusted basis. But part of that is because the, you know, the valuations are kind of marked to market, aren’t updated with as greater frequency as public markets. And these, you know, private investment firms aren't buying and selling with as much frequency as actors and traditional public markets. So in a way that kind of smooths over those, those rough economic and financial patches, it's not to say that their performance isn't strong, but there's there is kind of an element of the way that it's measured, you know, kind of making things look a little bit stronger on paper sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, that's a really interesting point. I want to get a bit deeper into the data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Bradley, maybe we can check to you for this one. I know one of the things that you mentioned in the report, was that you use the PWCC indices to kind of understand the market and what's happening. Can you quickly just explain to our audience, first of all, why is the PWCC indices so important for that? And then also, what are some of the limitations of using those indexes to look at the market today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. So PWCC they’re a marketplace and auction house and they have multiple indices, they have five ranging from the PWCC, 100 500, and then 2500. And their indices track a range of cards, but they are primarily vintage based. So you mentioned, like some of the shortfalls of those indices, one of them is that they do primarily track vintage cards, so cards dating really pre 1980s. And so PWCC, they really have the longest tenure as a performance tracking metric, they date back to the early…actually to 2008 is when the PWCC indices start. So you kind of get that tail and in the 2009 timeframe of the financial crisis. So you have one of the reasons why I believe that they're used so frequently is not only because they date back, but more importantly, because they date back to a very specific moment in financial markets history. And they, if you look at the indices, they do change in terms of their composition, but they primarily revolve around your blue chip Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth cards, whether they're rookies or just pre-war, or close to post-war cards, and those cards while they've performed very well, it's not always the greatest representation of the overall market. As I had discussed previously about how the broader market struggled but the blue chip higher end market performed very well, we just saw that happen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if you're looking at, you know, the last six to nine months, you might see a lot of cards across the board. And a lot of cars, maybe people on here owned, have maybe dropped in value. But meanwhile, we're seeing some record sales for Honus Wagner or Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth, or whoever that player might be in their rookie cards or in some of their early cards, that maybe is not the greatest representation of the overall market. So that's the one challenge, it is used just because we need some way of tracking an industry that has a composition of multiple cards across a span of time. But as with any industry, it might not be the best representation of the overall market and also of the sale frequency. So it's not necessarily looking at in a downturn market, is the volume still the same? Are people still selling their cards in that period of time? Are people still buying those cards in that period of time? Is the market still as active? There's a lot of metrics that maybe aren't incorporated in some of those indices, which do create the shortfalls, but are still important to include in any research and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eI think it's such an interesting distinction, definitely when I started to learn more about sports cards, the distinction between like the vintage older cards, and then the more modern sports card, and perhaps you can both touch on this. Why do vintage markets perform so differently than like, more modern sports cards? Is it purely just about scarcity and supply? Or are there other factors that we can look at?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so this is, this was definitely one of the more interesting kind of tidbits to come out of our Q2 analysis. If you looked at second quarter performance of vintage and prewar cards, they were effectively flat down very, very slightly 1 to 2% versus modern and ultra modern cards, which were down in the neighborhood of 15 to 20%. And I think part of that is, you know, modern and ultra modern tend to be a bit more speculative in nature, you have speculation on players that are currently active younger players, people who have more of their career left in some areas, particularly in the ultra modern space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd when you look at vintage, there's a very long tenured collector base, the scarcity is naturally very low, just just by nature of the fact that these cards have been around for decades and decades. You know, over time, some have been lost, they've been damaged, so supply is very low. And I think, you know, many collectors aren't turning these cards over with as great a frequency - they're holding on to them. And that means less supplies available to the market, which of course can help keep, you know, prices kind of higher as demand grows, or even stays the same. And that's where you find a lot of quote unquote, blue chip cards that are very, very popular historically that are very well known, that are kind of like the top pieces of almost akin to fine art in this category. So a bit less speculation, less supply, and more longer tenured collectors and holders of these assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and then just to add, there's also been so many market shifts across you know, when these cards were initially coming out, think about some of the cards maybe you've seen breaking records like a T 206 Honus Wagner like these were really advertisements. They weren't built for card collectors. They weren't being produced in mass for you know..they were being produced and then slid into a pack of gum or candy or cigarettes, or they were being stuck at tables at diners. They weren't being produced where then we saw that shift in the 70s, 80s, 90s, where then it rotated into what is known as the junk wax era where you had producers of cards, pumping out incredibly high quantities of cards. There's a ton out on the market, you don't really see a whole lot of 1990s players with high, high sales in their cards and today, the shift has really turned to grading where we’re seeing such an increase in cards being graded. People are sending them off to places like Beckett, PSA, SGC to be graded and a very high percentage of cards within populations are being graded. So it's just been a real overall shift in the market that has definitely aided I think vintage as standing out and standing alone from a period of time where people weren't collecting cards maybe for investment pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e Bradley can you kind of go –I think that's a really interesting point you brought up on the grading, right? Can you kind of go a bit deeper? What is the impact on the market overall of you know, you're getting more PSA 10s You're getting more BGS 9.5 or whatever, like, what is the impact on vintage versus modern?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. It’s an impact that I don't think is probably being discussed enough. We do cover it quite a bit. We have a partnership with a company called Gem Rate, who tracks the percentage and the number of cards graded by companies like I mentioned previously, PSA, Beckett,STC. And for example, just PSA alone, they're seeing record cards coming through and being graded in items altogether. You know, their Q2 numbers, and this past quarter were the highest they've ever had graded. I believe the past month was their highest month on record. So at this point, you know, they've had two months this year, believe it was March, and then now July that have been their two highest grading totals in company history, in terms of just number of items.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that impacts everything because a lot of these prices, especially in modern cards are dictated by the grade. So for example, PSA grades on a numeric scale one to 10. With as well as an authentic grade if the card is maybe in too poor of quality, to receive a number. But a PSA 10, which would be like a gem mint card, the highest tier, will historically sell for higher than a PSA nine of that same card, right? There may be a flaw in the nine that deducts that one point. The problem is that people today are pulling cards out of packs and sending them immediately to PSA, the card has a higher chance than receiving a 10. And in turn, that overall population is skyrocketing, right? We're seeing some players like in the NBA, Zion Williamson, John Moran, where they have super high numbers of - I mean talking 10s of 1000s of PSA 10 graded cards for some of their base cards right now. Where for example, with the vintage, you have to almost get to the 60s before you start seeing a lot of these cards, receiving tents and that just comes down to people weren't pulling them and sending them out\u0026nbsp;immediately from packs. So it definitely is having an impact. And I think long term, we're going to see a swell of cards that were graded, that received 10s. It's going to be very difficult to really ever find appreciation and an increase in value when you have a card that has 20,000+ grades, and then maybe 10 to 15% of that population is a PSA 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd if you think about it, Calum, if you're an owner of a great advantage card, the threat of the population have that card growing now and really making your card a lot less valuable just by nature of the supply growing is a lot lower relative to modern because you know these cards have been in circulation they've been unwrapped from packs decades ago, you know, every now and then yes, some some new population will find its way to the to the grading companies. But you know, the likelihood of that happening at scale is much lower than it is for modern and ultra modern cars, and that's why the kind of the risk return formula, so to speak, for vintage is a lot different than it is for modern and ultra modern cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think that's super interesting. I'm going to ask one more question on the card point before we shift over to game one memorabilia and memorabilia overall, which I know is a very different picture than the card market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think one thing that was interesting as I was going through the report is amongst all kind of the doom and gloom in the sports card market, there were some promising signs. The economist David RPA, modern hockey card record sale at Heritage last month, the upcoming heritage auction for the Mantle. Can you both just kind of comment on those two sales and what you think they might indicate about the market overall as we look forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean the Mantle sale - so for context, one of the very highest graded 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle cards is up for auction at Heritage auction later this month, the special card because basically what happened was, these cards weren't wildly popular. When they were released back in 1952. They sat on shelves, and it was time for basically the 1953 print run to start being sold and tops needed the warehouse space. So they basically dumped boxes, and boxes and boxes of these cards into the ocean. And Mickey Mantle is kind of one of the preeminent, you know, baseball, cultural icons, certainly baseball card icons. And so probably one of the four very best examples of this card is being auctioned later this month. It's already over $7 million at auction, there's, I think, a pretty strong expectation that it's going to end up at $10 million plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time there was a sale of..so that's an SGC 9.5 Mickey Mantle. Back in early 2021, there was a sale of a PSA nine mantle for $5.2 million. And, you know, the stats are pretty clear that afterwards, not only did the broader and kind of lower quality Mantle market absolutely soar higher, but you could make the argument that, you know, it led to, you know, significant appreciation in the broader card market as well. It's a really big deal when a sale that big makes a very wide range of mainstream news headlines, because that creates new demand. It gets people excited about the space again, and it tends to have pretty wide ranging impacts. Now granted, it does take a sale of $5 million or $10 million to generate that excitement, which is exceedingly rare, but it does happen and it'll be really interesting to see, you know, what happens in the wake of that sale next month, or later this month rather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd all along the Mantle card has always stood out from a baseball standpoint, similar to in hockey. We've had a seven figure sale of Wayne Gretzky, but we have also been tracking as you mentioned, the McDavid card. So modern hockey has similar to some of the other modern sports has lagged pretty significantly in terms of the overall market. So in the first quarter, golden oxygens sold a Sidney Crosby card. It was a gold precious metal gems and went for 100 in just under $165,000, which set a record for any modern hockey card. And then in this past quarter or the past quarter we've just had or past month, there was a 2015 Connor McDavid card, which is an autographed patch card. So it has a patch from a game worn jersey within it, and it's sold for $228,000. So that established a new modern hockey card price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd actually, this is very timely, because just this week, there was one of the other so there are three cards in the population for the Connor McDavid that are graded PSA 10, and another one just sold this week for just over $200,000. So heading into the second quarter, we had never had a sale for a modern hockey card go for more than $200,000 and now we've had one, you know, essentially in the past 30 days now we've had two cards, same card, same grade, but it was definitely a validating sale to see one sell via eBay for over $200,000. So definitely some momentum within that market. But again, it's really a couple names: Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby, Alexander Ovechkin. But beyond those three, hockey though, just continues to trail the field overall for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, very interesting. I'm conscious that we're nearly at time. Everyone can stay on if they're interested to hear more, because we're gonna go into the sports memorabilia market. And I think if Q1 was kind of, you know, there was a plunging in the sports card market. I think it was the exact reverse on the sports memorabilia side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould you, and I'll put this to both of you. Can you kind of just give us some context, data wise what we saw with sports memorabilia, and then also like, what is the significance like why did this happen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so on kind of the second part of that question first. So when the sports card market was was booming, you'd see, and Bradley just alluded to one of them, you would see these cards that have little patches from either a game worn or player player worn jersey, selling for, you know, hundreds of 1000s of dollars, which in many cases is more than a full game used jersey would actually sell for. And so I think for the last few years, people both outside of the space, especially but also inside the space, have kind of taken a step back and said like, that doesn't make any sense. Like why is this little patch that's, you know, encased in cardboard selling for more than an entire game use jersey. And I think, you know, the idea that that shouldn't necessarily be the case has started to take hold, and the second quarter we saw, really for the entirety of 2022, but really in the second quarter we saw game worn jersey sales make headlines, there was a Diego Maradona, game worn jersey from the famous Hand of God World Cup match sold for over $9 million. Sotheby’s Golden Age auctions sold a set of Tiger Woods clubs from when he won the tiger slam for over $5 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so we just saw a huge volume of sales that were kind of headline sales that were over six figures. So to put it in context, in the second quarter of 2022. There were 42 sales at auctions of game used memorabilia that crossed $100,000. A year ago in the second quarter, there were just 13. So you're talking about more than triple, you know, increase. And I think a lot of that is, you know, card collectors coming into this space and realizing that there's, you know, an opportunity to own some incredible artifacts that, you know, maybe stand out from kind of the traditional to their traditional kind of cardboard pursuits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we put out actually a thread today on Twitter, Altan Insights, where we covered some of these record breaking sales and sports memorabilia. And one of the big highlights is, you know, the record books have really been reconstructed this year. There's three of the five largest public sales ever that have occurred. In terms of sports memorabilia, just this year alone. Dylan mentioned the Maradonna and then also the Tiger Woods. Also the Muhammad Ali championship belt that's sold. So we're just seeing the shift of people going after these really high end really impressive items that have historic context around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it's really exciting to see this shift in this movement of money that's going after you look at even at the Heritage auction coming up that we mentioned, there's the Mickey Mantle card, and that's going to be the big headline grabber. But very likely we'll see a new record set for a baseball bat. There's a 1918,1920 circa Babe Ruth game used in sign that that right now is priced just under a million dollars. I wouldn't be surprised if it by the end of the auction is a multi million dollar bat. It's a really impressive piece that is one of the earliest bats on the market that we've ever seen. I know there's been a lot of collectors out there looking for Babe Ruth's first bat that he used. So that had hit the market back in the early 2000s and went for over a million dollars. It hasn't came back yet. But this bat is probably about the second best thing that we've ever seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the momentum is just continuing within the space. And also just announced yesterday, I believe Sotheby's is going to be selling a Michael Jordan jersey from the 1998 NBA Finals. And that jersey will likely establish not only a new record for any Michael Jordan, game use jersey, but actually any basketball jerseys. We would need to get up to about 4 million to do that. It has an estimate between 3 to 5 million, but with the momentum we're seeing in the prices for other athletes like Ali marathon Tiger Woods, probably seems fitting that Michael Jordan would fit in somewhere in that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNow that's pretty iconic. You know, one thing I wanted to follow up on when we talk about these really high sale prices, especially with sports memorabilia. I know one thing that comes into it is the photo matching element. Could you guys just speak briefly about - refresh the audience on what is photo matching, first of all? And then why has it become so important in the valuation of these assets?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, photo matching has become a critically important topic. I think it always, not always, but it has been important over the last few years, but its importance has only increased as you see these very high value auction items being sold, and therefore the stakes being raised. And essentially, for those that don't know, you know, if you talk about something like a Michael Jordan worn jersey, or you know, a Wayne Gretzky worn jersey from the Stanley Cup, you want to know, if you're paying millions of dollars for this item? How do I know that he wore it in this game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so what photo matching is to kind of simplify it is basically comparing the game worn Jersey in question to very high resolution photos taken during the game in question, to match up very kind of, in most cases, minute details to confirm that this is indeed the jersey that was worn by that player in that game. And it can be things as small as you know, different holes in the mesh different, you know, little pieces of stitching, and how they appear on the jersey and, and matching those elements to the Jersey that's being sold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, I think when these very large prices are being paid, authentication is so very critical for the credibility of the market, for the credibility of those selling the item. And then for the buying collector to you know, be reassured that the item they've spent money on was who was really as built. And so photo matching is one way that that's accomplished. And you're kind of hard pressed to see nowadays, items sell for very high values without being photo matched to, you know, a certain moment. Generally not the case for more vintage items, for obvious reasons that the high resolution photography that you need to really make a conclusive photo match wasn't available until really, really more recently, but definitely important for any kind of more modern piece of game worn material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd to follow up, we dove into some of the data behind that photo matching and just looking at so in Q2, out of the top 10 sales, eight of them were marketed as being photo matched. And so there's a few companies out there Resolution, My Gray, who photo match these items, and 18 of the top point five items sold memorabilia wise at auction in the second quarter, add some label or some nod to photo matching, and that compares to 60% of the top 10, the previous year, 12 out of the top 25. So a pretty big difference. It's been around as Dylan had mentioned, but at this point, especially as we start to see these modern assets and the memorabilia side, continue to develop in price, it's pretty much necessary outside of a certificate or a letter of authenticity from the league, or the player itself. You know, memorabilia has always been a little bit of a money market because a lot of these assets weren't supposed to ever make it to an auction house, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Tiger Woods clubs that Golden Age sold, there was a little dispute because Tiger Woods and his agent claimed to still have the clubs, because there's almost this idea that they're not supposed to ever leave the player and it's somebody's responsibility to grab that jersey after the game and keep it, or to secure the club so they never see an auction house. But it was the work of some experts in the space that looked at a bunch of attributes around the clubs between the grip to ball marks to photos, and then were able to provide an opinion a photo match that pretty clearly had an impact considering they sold for over $5 million and easily exceeded any previous golf clubs sold by about $5 million. So it's having an impact on these markets, no question about it. And I really think in the next few years, it's going to become...if it's anything that is photo-matchable so it's not vintage, but it's anything really 1970 on it's going to require some sort of photo matching being a given for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's really interesting, and to be honest, it's pretty incredible that some of these assets they can even match it using photographs and all these things. Before we close out, I wanted to talk about the Muhammad Ali belt. Huge sale, there $6.18 million. I think the initial estimate was to be around like a million dollars.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you talk about what was the level of photo matching that we saw there? What was some of the story behind that? Like, why did it exceed the estimate by such a large degree?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is actually one of those interesting and rare cases where there actually wasn't a photo match at hand. And really, what the kind of source of you know, credibility and authenticity here was the provenance so meaning what was kind of the line of ownership from, you know, when the belt was on Muhammad Ali to when it came to auction. So a little bit of background, I think it was last month, heritage sold the WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that Muhammad Ali earned for his win in the Rumble in the Jungle, and they sold it for just under $6.2 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis one came from the collection of Drew Bandini Brown, who was Ali's corner man. He kept a lot of artifacts, memorabilia from all of his career in a storage unit. Eventually, the contents of that storage unit were sold. But it's a case where you know you have pretty strong provenance. You know where that belt’s been, you feel fairly confident that this is a belt that was earned by Ali - it was worn by Ali.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it really led to a bidding war between two bidders who were seemingly unwilling to lose. Turns out the winner was Colts owner Jim Irsay, who has basically been building a museum quality collection of kind of American cultural artifacts that he's actually taken on tour. So it's like, it's one of my favorite kind of investing rules for you know, really blue chip alternative collectibles is like, would Jim Irsay buy this because time and time again, he invariably shows up as a winner of a lot of these auctions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, one of those rare cases where, you know, photo matching wasn't playing a significant role in the authenticity here. But sometimes at an auction, all it takes is two highly motivated bidders to drive a value to, you know, levels that people previously thought were unheard of. Especially interesting in this case, because there is another WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that actually trades fractionally. And, you know, now that the question becomes, you know, what's that one worth? So definitely an interesting, very interesting piece of memorabilia. Very interesting story, and, you know, another just massive result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eJust as a follow up, I actually spoke this week with a representative from Heritage who runs some of their consignment, and was talking to him at one point about that night when it's sold, and it was out of the blue for them. So we talked about where something like that comes from, he had actually gone to sleep, said he woke up at like 3am and stuff was like still going. And to see, you know, they, you know, some people that are going to be involved in the auction, for example, they set a million dollar estimate, they had word of mouth from some potential betters that those bidders weren't going to let it go for under a million. But that's all it takes is two bidders on some of these items.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the same could go for this Mantle card coming up at the end of the month, or the Jordan jersey in September that I mentioned previously, like, it just comes down to if you have some people who are willing to put out that kind of money. And now we're at a point where that table and that tier has been set, where now it used to be a million dollars was a big hurdle for an auction house to clear. If they could clear that million dollar, you know, everyone was clapping and it was a really respectable auction. And that meant that they had a really strong line of bidders where it's almost 5 million at this point where, you know, it's like you're expected to have bidders lined up that are willing to push these items higher and higher the levels that we just haven't seen up until this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, it's pretty incredible to be honest, when you look at some of the other asset markets for crypto, for stocks, and you see how bearish people are and kind of the the sentiment there that we still have some of these really high ticket sales and records being broken in some of the alternative asset markets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDylan and Bradley, It's been a pleasure to have you guys on the show again, you're always welcome. Thank you to the audience and everyone that listened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you, Calum.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture trend investing. I'm your host Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Today, we are joined by Gerard Starkey, sports memorabilia expert, and co-founder of SAAS. Over the last 20 years, Gerard has built one of the most valuable and complete Michael Jordan player exclusive game worn collections in the world, and has been featured in Highsnobiety and elsewhere, as one of the preeminent MJ collectors. Sports memorabilia is a really exciting alts category, and he'll be demystifying it for us today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we get to that, though, we're going to cover some of the biggest headlines happening in the world of alts in a section I like to call five and five, five headlines in five minutes. Let's get started. So first of all, Nike sold a virtual NFT sneaker designed by artists to Kashi American army for $134,000. The sneaker was one of 20,000 in Nike;s first release with artifact in April. Collectors are hoping the shoes will become part of games like fortnight and Grand Theft Auto Six, while others are interested in physical versions of the shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eeBay is launching its first ever NFT collection. Thirteen limited edition NFTs that feature 3D animations of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky making one of his signature moves. They plan to drop additional NFT collections throughout the year in partnership with web3 platform OneOf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world's largest bottle of whiskey was sold for $1.4 million by auction house, Lyon and Turnbull on May 25. The bottle stands at an incredible 5’11 and was given a Guinness world record for being the world's largest bottle of whiskey in September 2021. It contains enough to fill about 444 standard bottles, or enough to make 5,287 whiskey sours, which is pretty crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew York based real estate, investment and brokerage firm Acada listed a New York building as an NFT on OpenSea for 15,000 ETH, approximately $27 million. The NFT represents ownership of the building. However, the buyer still has to follow standard real estate procedure offline for the transaction to go through.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, a former OpenSea employee has been indicted in the first ever case of NFT insider trading. Thirty-one year old former Product Manager Nathaniel Chastain was responsible for selecting which NFTS would be displayed on OpenSea’s homepage. He would then use that information to buy those NFTs before they were featured, and then flip them for 2-5x profits after that. So that's our five and five for today. We're now going to switch over to speaking with our guest Gerard Starkey. Gerard, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to have you on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks for having me on.

So just to begin, can you give us a backstory? I think you have like the most valuable MJ game on collection out there. Can you kind of just give us an intro into how you got into collecting these items?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI think first just to correct slightly, at one point in time, I was definitely the most valuable Michael Jordan collector, but in the recent in recent years, some very, very large investors have come in and bought up, you know, millions of millions of dollars of items in a very short span of time. So I'm definitely up there in the top two or three guys, but I'm possibly not the most valuable at this stage. But I was at one point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, you're in the conversation for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm definitely up there. But I don't want to claim the crown without giving my peers and fellow collectors, you know, the same type of esteem all the way up at the top there. For me it started before value was even a concern because for me it started out of pure passion as a teenager. And as you said earlier on, I've been collecting for about 25+ years. And I didn't necessarily start in Michael Jordan stuff. Specifically like stuff he'd actually used. It actually started just in the kind of the regular kind of original Jordans that were available at the time and and gradually progressed through the various kind of categories of collecting whether it was like originals, hard to get rare samples, back to originals again, and then the original market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginal releases of the Jordan shoes where it was very hot in late 90s, early 2000s, like it was, it just increased massively. And I actually was given a pair of game-worn Jordans from an ESPN athlete, I can go into that story at some point, but I was given them by an ESPN, so a cameraman, who was French. And when, as soon as I held that asset, the asset that I previously owned at the time, but that I previously collected didn't mean as much to me, because I had this asset that, you know, represented this athlete. And at that point, I took the opportunity to sell all my originals, which I sold very quickly. And I basically plugged it all into actual game news items. And now that was not as easy to find, but I'm quite resourceful. I speak seven or eight languages.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I basically went into the market on a global scale and just bought everything I could. And this went on for about 1015 years before the real boom happened, and I did it quite silently, because that was just my strategy, not quite being quite a competitive person. And being well, I was based in London, most of that time. So all of my peers were in Asia and the States. So for me to get stuff, I have to really hustle and bustle and just just grab as much as I could. And yeah, to this day, I don't sell my own collection, I just vault stuff and enjoy it and have it on display at my home and rotate it and collect things. I still obviously enjoy collecting. But you know, it's much harder now because the caliber of items I want to collect it's large sums of money. And I have to be quite selective, to be honest. Because I can't compete with all the bigger players in the current market. However, I obviously have a number of assets that these guys want. So the only way for me to really get into some of the really big, multimillion dollar items is to trade out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat's my collecting career in a nutshell and now I've built up so much expertise in the space that you know, I dibble and dabble in helping the Jordan Brand, do marketing campaigns. I am an adviser to big collectors around the world, helping them build up their collections. I do storytelling in displays around the world with various clients and partners. And I've got my own authentication company SAAS where, just like Public's doing, my main goal is to educate so that people can understand the assets, appreciate the assets, and get a really good sense of the value of the assets, because I think that's quite important. I think that is going to be the key element of this particular space, and actually any collecting space is going to focus on in the next sort of three to five years. It's all going to be about really getting specific, really getting clear valuations of stocks. At the moment, I think things are still bouncing around. But we'll get into that as we go through the question. So that's me and my collection, career from start to end and looking forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, sweet as you were saying that I was like, Gerard is living the dream, like the dream of any NBA fan, Michael Jordan fan. He is living it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask you because I think this is really interesting, and also just to give people in the audience a bit more context. Can you talk us through some of like those highlight pieces, those assets that are currently in your collection? Maybe like two or three of your favorite ones? And then also take us through like, how did you even get it? Maybe you can give us like a quick story of an interesting acquisition story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, I think probably the asset that I own, the pair of shoes I own that people will most likely recognize, is that I own The Shot. So I own the Black Cement Jordan 4s that Michael Jordan wore when he hit the shot over Craig Ehlo of the Cavs. And that for me is definitely in terms of emotional value an asset that captures a really big turning point not just in Michael Jordan's career but in the whole basketball, NBA kind of history. It's, in my opinion, its top three, possibly top one or two moments ever. So that's definitely, in my opinion, the biggest asset that people will really appreciate, I think on a global scale without question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI own obscure pieces like the Nike Alpha Force that Michael Jordan wore in the same kind of period, as he was wearing Jordan, threes and fours and he was trying to, you know, get comfortable in the shoes. There's some talk about him, it being a transition point, as am I going to stick with Jordan, they're trying different midsole shoes models, and he actually started wearing Nike Alpha force, which isn't the Jordan shoe. But he wore them two or three times, and I have the pair that he played in against the Milwaukee Bucks. So that's a cool, very unique piece, not as big a celebrity as The Shot. But definitely for me, it's a piece that I appreciate a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then you're seeing other other shoes that I would love to have in my collection that have eluded me. I mean, the obvious one, for me is the last shot, which is Michael Jordan's final pair of shoes, which, I mean, I've literally searched for, I mean, I'm a resourceful man. And I've searched for it far and wide. And I mean, there's two pairs out there. And one of them potentially, is that model. But there's also a possibility that Michael Jordan has kept that one himself, which would make sense to me. But it's just not a pair that I've ever been able to acquire. But that would be monumental. And I mean, the closest pair I've seen to that very last pair is actually up at Christie's actually, it's an auction I've held here, the shameless plug, but there is an amazing, low 13 game-worn Michael Jordan sample that's actually on the market as we speak. And that's pretty much as close as I think any of us will get to that last shot ever. And that's, that's an amazing piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you even think to yourself,\u0026nbsp;“I would love to own the last shot piece” or “ the last shot sneaker,” how does that process of even trying to track it down start? Is it all just personal connections? What's that research process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, I mean, my process is I mean, everybody knows I'm an actuary by profession. So my mind is quite analytical, I love a good spreadsheet. I love a good list. So over the years, I've basically built databases of you know, where these assets are, whether it's jerseys, shoes, bats, helmets, you know, not necessarily specific to Michael Jordan, but where big assets are, who owns them, you know, their numbers, their emails, some photos of those assets, the tagging just so I can keep myself fully educated as to you know, the authenticity and what I should be looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do actually have big personal databases that you know, are super valuable to me and help me try to track these things down. And once you get into the circle you know, you do meet insiders, insiders to these athletes, these these these gods so to say, of the world and you can navigate through, there is a there's a way to navigate through that community and figure out how to get out get out assets once you do a deal. Whenever I do deals in the past, it was never you were never buying one item. It wasn't efficient, you were potentially having to get on a plane and travel to Hong Kong or New York and as I said I was based in London in Europe most of the time. So if I was going in, I was going for the kill and I was going to buy as much as I could, you know? And when you get known to be a reliable person who does deals who buys stuff off the medics, the teammates, the ball boys, you know, use that they pass your lap around respectfully and they and you can you know pay the right money for the assets. And at the time it was much simpler like I said they were trying to get rid of assets anonymously without you going to the market. You know, there wasn't really a deep liquid market for them at that point. They also didn't want to be known to be selling the asset that Michael Jordan gave them, so it was much easier. But that's how I go about it and I apply the same technique. Circle still exists, you know, there are other layers, there are more auction houses, there are more dealers, there are more middlemen, but it's just navigating the space. Like any space just like buying a house or a property, it's very similar actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I want to zoom out a little bit. I know, there's probably a lot of people in the audience who are interested in potentially investing in sports memorabilia, and just learning more about the market in general, could you kind of just quickly define for us, what exactly is the sports memorabilia market, and then what makes this category special?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, sports memorabilia market as an asset, if I was thinking about in a real simple kind of definition, any asset that captures an athlete, either his image or a moment, or an event in sports history. And this can be purely a photo on a card, or an actual item used at that point in time or something with a signature from that era. It's a very broad category, so it captures the essence of an athlete.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an interesting category because, I mean, for me, first, take one quick step back to make it clear what the following statement means, to me, it's like an art. These are moments that people have created at the very peak of their career. And if anybody on the call has ever, you know, going down that route of being an athlete or doing a sport, you know, it is extremely difficult to work your way up that ladder to become the top person, just like any artists would have had to work, you know, hundreds of 1000s of hours, you know, to be known as the, you know, the Michelangelo or the Picassos of the world, you know, these athletes have created these moments by being that great. So for me, they aren't just rubber and canvas and suede and leather, and you know, and wood and whatever, whatever materials they use in the equipment. They're actual moments in time that represent something very deep, very hard to achieve, and hence, they are pieces of art, which you which become talking points become storytelling points. And that's how I treat it. So to me, it's art. It's the emotional value. It's the moment, it's a historical moment in time that they capture that they represent, that gives them value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think to your point, the emotional value is so strong, so strong, right? Like we remember those moments that MJ last game shot and different moments. One thing I'm interested in from the investor perspective, is what are some of the factors, the value drivers, of a certain piece of sports memorabilia? I know you mentioned obviously, the moment, like what it's associated with, the athlete. Is there anything else? Can you kind of just elaborate on what some of those important factors are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, those are extremely important facts that you raised. But I think rarity is key, like with any asset. And now the space is becoming much more liquid, and much more, much more educated, people really understand what rarity actually actually means. Now, for me, rarity is literally a handful, you know, and I know there are assets out there. I mean, there is an intersection between demand, and, and supply. And, you know, the perfect example for me is like the card market, the sports card market, there could be 200,000 people who want this one card, and there's only 700 of them, and that seems like a very high demand ratio. And I agree, but actually, ultimate or absolute rarity, where you can have something that like two or three or no other person has, that for me is the ultimate factor. And as we get more educated, we need to know how to filter down to what that rarity actually means. So, in cards, there's, you know, there are populations, there are I mean, you have to think of what is important in the card, what is the emotional value in a card in the card mark is my interpretation. So all the basic stuff about the quality of the card, the centering of the card, you know, the edges of the card, how perfect that card is preserved, those are all very easy parameters to understand. The hard bit is actually delving down to actual rarity and the authenticity and the you know, and the meaning meaningfulness of that card.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think with cards, the excitement usually comes from, say, pulling a card. So being able to calculate and understand the probability of you actually pulling that card that is going to be a big factor in rarity. Which athlete it was related to, that's going to have a big big driver of value and rarity, you know, within each of those athletes, each of those athletes have one or two cards that are the cards to have actually, they probably will have one card is the card. And if it is\u0026nbsp;the card that is in your basic kind of starting point, this is the card I want for Gretzky or for Mantle or for MJ. And then you have to take that particular card and then filter that particular example down into the best version of that example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith game used stuff, it's slightly more complex because once it's far more complex, because it's there's you know, authenticating a card is quite simple, because they are just pieces of paper that capture that nostalgia, authenticating and valuing game used jerseys and shoes is there a lot more intricate details to look at tags and where and you go down this angle of the photo matching, and we'll talk about a bit more about photo matching later on. But after photo matching and understanding signatures, it then gets into this kind of moment, space. And up to that photo matching kind of factor that you're considering, the prices on these things will be kept because it's you know, it's just photo matched. And it could be, you know, just a regular season game, but it's photo match, you know, he wore it. So it's great, it's a great asset, but the price will be capped. The moment it's photo matched, but also the moment that it's photo matched to a huge or significant or turning point, then the price will just shoot up. And that's because it's rarity, meaningfulness, emotional value, and, and that's what these assets, you know, that's why those assets then sort of transition from a sports card or sports item into a piece of art and a piece of history. And I think people are getting far more educated. I mean, there are a lot of sports thinkers, kind of like myself and there's lots of people in the market who\u0026nbsp;try to go out there and kind of give these parameters to people and give that kind of food for thought. So they can think about the value themselves. And it is complicated, but I do really feel that the market is getting very sophisticated. And buyers we're getting very sophisticated and very demanding. And that's right, I think, and I actually support that a lot because it gives us base credibility and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, one thing I think that's so interesting, as I was listening to you speak is that, and I think this is a great point also for our audience. As you know, they continue to learn more about alts. And I'm even on my own journey of learning more about alts. And I think every kind of alts category has its own nuances, you know, when it comes to evaluating an asset. So for instance, you gave the example of sports cards where like the grading and the condition of the card is like a huge determinant. There's different determinants when you look at things like the art market or comic book market. And then obviously, sports memorabilia. Could you just elaborate a bit more? You spoke about photo matching, can we start at the beginning? Like what is even photo matching? Can you kind of just explain that whole process, like what does it even mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eSo photo matching - this will apply to game used stuff firstly, so you photo match game used items. And what that effectively means is that using images and video for when the asset was actually used. You're effectively able to superimpose the asset you have in your hand on top of the image, and every single crease, loose thread game used blemish, production blemish lines up so that it is absolutely conclusive that the asset you have in your head is the exact asset used by Maradonna or by you know, MJ or by David Beckham. And there is zero doubt there. I mean, it's just conclusively matched and attributed to that particular moment. And then if that moment is a big moment, then that's the next stage of kind of research and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Actually, to be honest, and in my opinion, once you've got the photo matched assets, you get so far up the chain. It's the moment that really adds value. You know, and I think, and the uniqueness of that moment moment and, you know, factors that you that the asset has that relate to that moment, you know, for example, I mean, a perfect example of a photo matched asset is something that Public actually have within their portfolio is the Shattered Backboard, Air Jordan 1, which is I mean, I'm obviously biased, because, you know, I was I was involved in that particular transaction some years ago. But that asset has photos of Michael Jordan, taking off his shoes, and giving them to the other athlete. Now, that's just unheard of. And that particular nuance parameter is super important because it not only photo matches the asset to something that MJ would have worn in a big moment, but it also photo matches the backstory and the provenance. So there's, you've conclusively photo matched but also conclusively fact checked, and you have photographic evidence of the backstory and how it actually got from Michael Jordan's feet, to the open market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the fact that Michael Jordan was the person handing the asset over is so significant, because usually, it would go into the admin team or his charity team, or, you know, his, you know, there would be a process because he was such a huge, huge, huge athlete, and he was huge from from day one. I mean, people knew he was a big deal from day one. So to have an asset that comes direct from him, insane. And for me, personally, I mean, if I would have value, it's way up there. It's way up there. I mean, Maradonna’s hand of God, and you know, Kobe's rookie jerseys have absolutely nothing on that particular shoe. But it requires a level of understanding and appreciation of what it actually is, you know?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's so interesting. I'm kind of interested to talk and like, get your opinion on what's happening in the market currently. I know, if we look at the top of the market, we saw in 2021, there was the sale of the 1984, Michael Jordan Airships, which kind of set a record at Sotheby's for over $1.4 million. What have we seen happen from that point? I know you alluded to some other things like sports memorabilia sales, just then the hand of God and different things. What are we kind of seeing in the market right now?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah so what is happening here is that the buyers and investors in these particular assets are extremely educated and they know exactly what they need that asset to have for it to be effectively a one of one, or a really big momentous moment. So the hand of God whatever the 9.3 million for that jersey, it makes absolute sense because it doesn't matter what what you do in life or what your interest in life, you know Diego Maradonna is and we know about that moment, and it's not particularly you know, a positive you know, it is a moment that that has a lot of controversy attached to it. And that just makes it a great asset, which is why that value makes sense. And it shows you the capability of some of these assets. You know, the Kobe Bryant rookie jersey is the one that sold for 3.6 and one that sold for 2.6, 2.7 photo matched rookie moment, rookie Jersey, obviously the passing of Kobe has helped those jerseys as well, rest in peace. But it just shows you that people really know what they want, it has to have every single parameter. If you had a photo of I mean, the Hodges who got the jersey from Maradonna is obviously proof a very good provenance, but there's no photo of Diego Maradonna giving the jersey to him, but it's obviously that the exact jersey because it's photo matched, and it was a very easy photo match and a great photo match. But it was such a unique moment. It was easy, but had Diego Maradonna signed that jersey or if there was an image of him, not being able to really speak English and Hodges saying hey, pointing Give me your jersey if that was documented it would be even more valuable. Similar to the Kobe jerseys, if there were other attributes that made it more unique, and that made the story more clear, the value just goes up, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think what's going on the market is people are really buying meaningful stuff. I mean, I can speak more. I think my knowledge is definitely more expert on the memorabilia side. And as a game used memorabilia side, and I think that's what's happening there. And in my view on the card market, is that people are getting more educated on what actual rarity is. And, you know, I think, game used, and cards, there's definitely a vintage, historic and kind of modern market. As always, with cards, I do just think, by default, the vintage market will always be more valuable. But obviously, as time surpasses, you know, the new market becomes vintage, and it will gradually grow. But there are giants in the sports world, and they've been the same giants for many, many years, even with, you know, Kobe Bryant is a good example. And I think, as I said, that's why I said his passing has added value to those particular jerseys.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the Michael Jordan, rookie jersey, you know, if there was a photo match one it would be significantly more valuable than that. And I think a lot of the collectors in the sports space would agree to that. I know Michael Jordan is still alive, but he's not going to create any more of those moments. I mean, I've seen, I've recently seen an amazing asset, which I can't wait until it comes to the market, but I've seen his playoff, his first playoff rookie shoes. And it's\u0026nbsp;a really great photo match. And if, you know, if a Kobe Jersey sells for $3.6 million, I can see when a shoe like that comes to market or just explode that particular value, because it's such an iconic shoe. And it's his very first playoff and it was used in like two or three of the game. So yeah, I think people want the big pieces, the big investment, the big pieces, this is helping the medium and lower side of the market. But I do think that side of the market will stabilize a bit more, and the value will be very clear to everybody. But yeah, so I think what's going on, I think education is going to be key in terms of estimating the values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, awesome. Okay, cool. I'm going to ask you one more quick question, because I know that we're running over. And I think I think it's such a great point that you make about education. And it's great to hear that, like, as the market is maturing that people, you know, they're getting more educated, they're getting more knowledgeable about these assets. And it's such a great time for the public, for our audience to then kind of come into these categories as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy final question for you was, you spoke about Maradonna, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. These are obviously like Pantheon all time, great athletes, right? When you look at the current kind of crop of athletes who are playing now, are there any that you look at and you think, once they're kind of game used, game worn memorabilia kind of gets out there in the future, it could rival in terms of the sale price? It could kind of rival what we've seen with like, the MJ assets or the Kobe assets or the marathoner assets. Are there any kind of athletes that you look at that will do that?,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah I definitely think they have potential to get up there. This is the will in the basketball world. The Lukas and the Steph Currys, they will get up there. The one thing I will say for the modern athletes, basketball and other sports, is that their game-issued items are much more abundant. So they will be just a much larger supply that also applies to cards as well as a huge supply of modern cards. I do think they can get up there but they literally have to check every single box it would have to be highest scoring game, best playoff run you know you won't really have many multi game worn stuff because of the abundance of the jerseys and stuff for example, but yeah there are definitely are players that will get up there in basketball and football I'm trying to think. Well obviously the Nemars and Mbappes of the world will get up there because there's a direct link there to the Messies and the Ronaldos and the Van Bastens of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think more of what would be the thing to look out for is the gods of the other sports where less focus is currently on at the moment. Those are the ones that will come up I think. I mean, I do honestly think basketball will always be Michael Jordan and then the Kobes and LeBrons and the other greats. Boxing will always be, you know, Mike Tyson. You know, the F1 Racing market will always be Schumacher. You know, Lewis Hamilton and Verstappen will be up there, you know, but everybody's going to want to go back to Schumacher. But I think with education and people understanding all the parameters that they're interested in and getting that real one of one meaningful moment, those will be the athletes we need to look out for that will just jump up there. So not necessarily specifically.. well, obviously, they have to be very good athletes in whatever sport they play, but it will be that one of one, this really unique story that makes them valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eSuper, super insightful.
