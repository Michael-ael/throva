For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.

I'm your host Kori Hale and of course, I'm always happy to be with you all, especially this afternoon. We're going to be breaking down what's going on in the regulatory environment as it relates to decentralized finance, better known as DeFi. We're going to be discussing crypto regulation, the recent actions taken by the US Treasury, along with the Securities Exchange Commission, and I am very thrilled to bring in our guest, Ari Redbord who is the Head of Legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs to discuss crypto regulation. And of course, the road ahead in 2023. Ari, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eHey, Kori, thanks so much for having me and really excited to join Public Live today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we're happy to have you and to have this discussion. We have a lot of crypto enthusiasts within our community and I'd love to start out by talking specifically about the US Treasury Department. They recently initiated a risk assessment related to illicit financial activities within the sphere of this DeFi space, in your opinion, are what are the primary vulnerabilities exploited by illicit actors in the DeFi sector?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, it's a really important question. And to kind of set the conversation a little bit, this risk assessment was actually ordered by the White House framework on digital assets, which came out about a year ago. So while it sort of created somewhat of a regulatory framework, it definitely tasked a number of agencies and one of the tasks was for the US Treasury Department to do a risk assessment on D fi. And really, really important to note that this is just that it's a risk assessment with a focus on sort of what are the risks in the ecosystem/ It is not guidance, and it is certainly not regulation. And throughout the document, really Treasury talks about the need to engage with the private sector, with other agencies, and really have a conversation about ultimately, sort of what guidance or regulation should look like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that said, it focuses on the areas that you see also in this sort of centralized crypto space, whether it's ransomware. Hacks are a huge vulnerability for the DeFi ecosystem. In 2022, According to us at TRM, we saw about 3.7 billion in hacks, and about 80, or more percent of those hacks were against the DeFi ecosystem, bridges, protocols, Dex is and that's what it's a real concern. So there's a lot in this thing, but really, really important to understand, like, why does it talk about risk? Well, you know, that's exactly what it was intended to do is provide a risk assessment of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, a risk assessment, I think, many people would probably agree that's definitely needed, given the nature of DeFi. And especially what's happened in the past six to nine months in the broader crypto sector. But I'd love to dig into it a little bit more, because there are illicit actors, right? There are people that are, you know, in this space that are not necessarily trying to do good things. And that's what I'd love for you to explain to our audience. All right, how do these criminals actually use DeFi services? To do things like launder ill? ill gotten gains?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, no, it's really important. And whenever I talk about DeFi, I'm currently the vice chair of the CFTC Technology Advisory Committee as well. And as I said at our last meeting, look, if you're going to talk about DeFi regulation, you really have to start with the promise of this technology, right? This idea of sort of on-chain financial services, where we can have peer to peer transactions, you know, at the speed of the Internet. I think the technology is really, really extraordinary. But anytime you can move funds across border at the speed of the Internet, there are going to be vulnerabilities and illicit actors are going to try to take advantage of it and I think the challenge is for regulators, and Treasury really lays this out, is how do we sort of provide regulatory guardrails to make this ecosystem safe, but at the same time sort of not stifle innovation? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the really, really big takeaways, I mean, I think, for me, the most interesting of this risk assessment, is what it says is sort of about regulation. And again, you know, this is not guidance, this is not regulation, but Treasury says, look, if you are engaging in financial services, whatever your level of centralization is, right? DeFi, CiFi, or traditional finance, you have regulatory obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act, which is the US anti money laundering law. And I think that's probably going to be the most controversial piece of all of this, because there are a lot of sort of, you know, folks in the DeFi space who say, look, this is truly decentralized, disinter-mediated software that doesn't have teams of compliance professionals, it's sort of what we've seen in the traditional space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think the regulatory piece is going to be a very big part of this. And to your question, I think what Treasury sees at least is, look, we have to ensure that there aren't gaps in regulation, and one of the gaps they see today is sort of non compliance in the DeFi space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, there definitely seems to be a lot of noncompliance. I want to pick up on something you said in terms of the Treasury, to look at how to not slow down innovation, but also, you know, providing, perhaps some type of risk parameters specifically, because we've seen this in other versions of tech, right, in different sectors where regulation has been at a much slower pace, right, than the actual technology and the innovation that's occurring. Is there something in what the Treasury is kind of proposing or what they're looking at that is specifically not going to slow down innovation? Are they always going to be two steps behind where DeFi is going? It?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri RedBord:\u003c/strong\u003eLook, I mean, government has always had this challenge. And I don't think we've ever seen anything move as fast in our lifetime, as we've seen the sort of crypto web three blockchain space. So it's always sort of this catch up game. Look, I think that you know, people are definitely appraising last week, the European Union, the European Parliament, passed Mica, the marketing crypto assets, legislation, really the first global sort of framework for digital assets, the sort of clear regulatory framework, and there's been a lot of praise around that. But when people sort of forget is that's about three years coming. That, you know, mica can't stem really from Facebook's sort of launch of the failed stable coin project Libra. So that's really three years ago, when European Parliament started thinking about Mica.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the reality is that yes, you know, governments and regulators are always going to be sort of far behind the technology. But at the same time, I think what we're seeing in this risk assessment is an acknowledgement by Treasury and the US government that it's so important to bring the private sector into these conversations, because what we do well in the private sector is innovate. And so far, I think we've seen some of those conversations already take place, which I think is a really good sign. In other words, I don't know that we're going to see enforcement actions, I shouldn't say, I don't think we're going to see enforcement actions from Treasury, again, sort of DeFi for not having compliance controls in place over the next year. So I think what we're gonna see is conversation,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eif we start to see those conversations. are those conversations spearheaded by the DeFi, by industry, by that sector, right? So that, by the time, you know, the government, so to speak, decides to catch up and actually put some regulation in place. They're basically doing their own internal audits, as you mentioned, compliance sort of thing. And they're already kind of lining up the sector to say, hey, these are the standards and rules that we're setting across the board. You know, while the government back on Capitol Hill just tries to figure out what they think it is we should do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, it's an excellent question, this sort of self regulation question that permeates the space. And I think, look, if you think about the native qualities of public blockchains, right, they're transparent. They're immutable. So in other words, they allow for tracing and tracking the flow of funds in ways you really never could in traditional finance. And that also allows us in many respects, to kind of regulate ourselves right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt TRM and a bunch of different industry players Circle and Binance and of others launched something called Chainabuse, which is essentially crowdsourcing, I think of it as the ways for crypto scams and frauds. It's a way this community can crowdsource to ensure that other people aren't taken by fraud and financial crime and you can report to law enforcement. So I say all of that to say like, I think that there are ways we can self-police the space in ways that were absolutely impossible in traditional finance, where we rely on intermediaries. So I think definitely, we are already seeing a world where not just DeFi but centralized exchanges are sort of coming together to sort of propose regulation and support regulation. But again, it's so important that this regulation doesn't go beyond what is intended to do and sort of stifle innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you talk about the companies and the things that people can do in this space, to perhaps self regulate, I guess it makes me think, Ari, what is what is after that, though, right? Because even if, regardless of if the government does it, or it's going to be self regulated, what happens to the illicit actors in the space? Are there sanctions? Are there obligations? If it's not going to be the government and it's going to be self regulated, who is the enforcer?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, it'll be the government, don't get me wrong, I think there's an aspect of self regulation that can actually absolutely occur, but I think it's gonna be a combination to be sure. And I will say this, look, you know, the nature of cryptocurrency, right? Cross border value transfer, this speed of the Internet is always going to be attractive to illicit actors. But when we see, you know, we see about the same amount of illicit activity in crypto as we do in the traditional financial system, which is a very, very small amount at the end of the day, almost infinitely small. So you're always going to have bad actors, right? If you don't have illicit actors in a financial system, it means the financial system is not robust, right? Bad guys are always going to want to engage, where sort of funds are flowing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that said, sort of the nature of crypto and the ability for regulators to have a view of their regulated ecosystem, in real time for law enforcement to be able to track and trace the flow of funds on public blockchains. This all means that crypto could be a lot safer, ultimately, than Fiat, which relies on sort of, you know, siloed, intermediaries who report to the government suspicious activity reports and this sort of thing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think the promise of the technology is, in part, the ability for regulators and law enforcement to use it and essentially, that's what we do at TRM. We provide software that enables that type of investigation and regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I mean, that's good to know that your company is obviously out there already in the marketplace providing solutions to some of these issues. I'd love to shift our attention, though, for a second really quickly towards the SEC specifically, because they did send Coinbase a WELLS notice in regards to the firm listing unregistered securities on exchange, and some time, as we know has passed since Coinbase actually received the notice are what specific violations of security laws has the SEC accused Coinbase of? It kind of seems like they sent a letter and like not much has happened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, look, there's this interesting..Certainly I'll first answer the question that is sort of, you know, the SEC is essentially saying look, Coinbase is listing unregistered securities, because certain cryptocurrencies are in SEC’s view, sort of most cryptocurrencies today are securities. And that's essentially the genesis of this letter. But that said, this is the issue that is permeating the entire space in the United States today. And it's really a definitional question, you know, are certain cryptocurrency securities? Are their commodities? Or are they something else? And every issue, whether it's sort of the CFTC, recent action involving finance, you know, talks about Ethereum as a commodity, but the SEC has talked about Ethereum as a security, or sees the asset rather as a security, and we see this letter to Coinbase. You know, there are cases involving, you know, sports celebrities and endorsers of FTX where one of the arguments in the case is that they were promoting unregistered securities. So ultimately, that question will be answered in that case, maybe from state to state courts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I say all of this to say that the biggest issue today in our space is, you know, are things commodities? Are things securities? And ultimately, you know, we're going to continue to see see enforcement actions and regulatory action, until Congress ultimately provides legal clarity and actually says, hey, look, Bitcoin is a commodity, and these other assets are you know, securities, or maybe even something else. And I think my view is that, look, you know, this technology is so new and so extraordinary, that maybe this can be something else. But I think the real issue is we need that type of legal clarity and probably needed from Congress. And until we get that, we're going to continue to see sort of disagreement amongst regulators and continued sort of enforcement actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, it definitely seems like the story continues to unfold in this space, because Coinbase as many of us know, here, they did take legal action against the SEC. And to be honest, that's not something you typically see companies do is take action against one of these government institutions, but this just happened on Monday related to the lack of clarity on securities regulations presented to the firm. Can you just explain for us? I'd love for you to break this down? What is Coinbase asking the court to do in its latest action against the SEC? And also did Coinbase do this, decide to take legal action against the SEC and for lack of a better term retaliation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, look, I think, you know, you know, obviously, this latest action by Coinbase is, you know, is sort of the latest example, but really what we've been seeing for the last, you know, several months or even more, really a year, are businesses looking for clarity from somebody, whether it's the courts, whether it's guidance from regulators, which is really in this case, sort of what Coinbase is asking the court to\u0026nbsp;make sure to get the regulator to provide, but it's like, look, you know, there's enforcement actions, you know, against us for listing unregulated securities in the words of Coinbase. But, you know, no one's ever told us, you know, what’s a security and what's a commodity here, they've only sort of proposed that, you know, we have obligations under a, you know, 60, or 70 year old Supreme Court case called US versus Howey where there's a conversation of whether or not orange groves and enterprise around orange groves are securities, are investment contracts. So I think what it is, is Coinbase and really, it's not just Coinbase it’s across the entire industry, is looking for clarity, you know, before you bring an enforcement actions, says Coinbase, or other entities, you know, we need an explanation, we need guidance from you as to what is a security and what is not a security?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and whether or not they get that guidance before all of this back and forth, you know, legal dispute that's now, you know, taking plays really comes to a head, I guess, only time will tell because, as you mentioned earlier, things are happening so quickly in this space quicker than we've seen, and other tech enabled spaces and there, there's a lot of moving parts right, Ari to work out here? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are so many and at this point, you know, we have the executive branch I mentioned, you know, our conversation today started with Treasury, right, and you have the SEC, and you have the CFTC. And you have the Fed, all involved in this. We have the legislative branch, we had a hearing last week on stable coins. And there's a proposed stable coin bill out there, which we're told is not going to necessarily, you know, move without some revisions. We have a number of other bills that have been proposed in Congress, but really no activity there. We have. And then we have the courts to your sort of last point, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we have all these different branches of government, you know, trying to sort of parse out a lot of these questions. But ultimately, it will come down to Congress to provide that sort of legislative clarity. And I'm not I'm not entirely sure that will be anytime soon. So we're likely to continue to see some of this sort of regulatory action from these agencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I'm sure that your company will, of course, be keeping a close eye on all the movements in this space, and we at Public will be definitely updating our community as things progress. Alright, I just want to thank you so much for joining Public live this afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is Ari Redbord - he's the head of legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs.

I'm your host Annika Lewis. Today we're joined by Pooja Rajan, founder of Etherworld and Ethereum community builder who will help us break down the game changing Ethereum upgrade that just happened, which has sparked a rally for the world's second largest cryptocurrency. Pooja, thank you so much for being here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. I'm so excited to be back here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, very big week. Lots of news to discuss. So plenty to cover today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFirst off, can you tell us a little bit about what just happened? So what was the Shapella upgrade? The combination of the Shanghai and Cappella upgrades – what does it accomplish? And why is it such a big milestone for Ethereum?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, of course. So Shapella, as you have beautifully explained, is a combination of Shanghai and Capella. So Shanghai executed four core EIPs on the main net, whereas Capella brought some specific changes on the consensus layer. So these four EIPs were \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEIP-4895, 3651, 3855, and 3860.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe rest\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e three EIDs, which starts from three, most of them are for EVM upgrades, EVM changes, and there was this 36511 coin base, which was a tool to make gas cheaply, cheaper for contract developers, however, EIP 4895, introduced a system level operation to support validator withdrawals. Withdrawals were the key change for this particular upgrade. So many people may know that Ethereum moved into proof of stake back in 2022 with the merge, but the proof of stake work on the chain started back in 2020 with the release of Beacon chain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe shift towards POS already happened in the past two upgrades. However, it closed the loop with the Shapella upgrade. So in 2020 when it was introduced it was unidirectional; people can only add ETH, become a validator and have their reward in the wallet but that was not realized. Shapella upgrade enabled accessing those rewards and validators can now go in and come out freely. If they want to stay they can come out with partial withdrawals and if they want to completely exit they can come up with the full withdrawal. So that's what the Shapella upgrade brought to the Ethereum Network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Thank you for the overview. And I would love to focus a little bit on withdrawals because they were one of the big headlines of this upgrade from what you just shared. And, of course, there were worries, folks had of initial rapid outflows after the upgrade. But just .3% of all 18.1 million tokens staked were actually withdrawn in the 12 hours after the upgrade based on data from Nansen. And so tell us a little bit about your perspective on withdrawals. Are you surprised at the low withdrawal rate? Why do you think stakers are keeping their Ethereum? What do you take away from all this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are a couple of things about it. I think that can be my perspective, which I would like to share with you. First of all, like, when people were trying to activate withdrawal, there was this validator credential change that has to happen before they can enable their withdrawal. So far, only 72 people validated credential has been updated, right at that time, when withdrawal, when this upgrade happened 40,000 credential changes took place. So that is the first thing, the first blocker for validators to withdraw because they have to first be able to change their credential. A message was signed, and many of the validators have already done it, but some of them are still in process. That's part one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other two parts are that the Ethereum chain has a churn limit like not everybody can withdraw their money at one point of time, at the same time. So they have to go through a process cue, there are certain limits for the partial withdrawal per day. Similarly, there are certain limits for full withdrawal per day, we try to maintain this protocol there. So we do not put the security of network for a concern at any point of time. There should be a good flow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's there for the second thing. And the most important thing, which I think is with this Shapella upgrade, obviously many validators were able to take out their XX the reward that they have earned over a period of time. And this gives confidence to many others who were planning to take out their money, or were planning to get into the system. So I think the Shapella upgrade gives a lot of confidence to existing and new validators to continue doing their duties as a validator on the network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome, appreciate that rundown. Talking a little bit more about just kind of the withdrawal risk and helping people understand the theory and how it works. So, about 16% of all the ether supply has been locked up in the protocol for staking as of earlier this month, you talked earlier about the Ethereum chain having a turn limit and not everyone being able to withdraw at once. So, what would happen in theory, if stakers decided to withdraw a lot in a large portion of that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLarge portion here can be the maximum that they have earned plus the deposit that they have made on the network. I think the average is somewhere around 34 ETH per validator on the network as of now. So, if again, the validator decided to take out all that means they are making full withdrawal at any particular time that they are willing to make that withdrawal and they are signaling about it. With the process of withdrawal there is another process going on in parallel is becoming a validator. If we take a look at the chart like I had data for the month of February, we have a good amount of validators also getting in.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, with that churn limit, we definitely do not see the network in threat at any point because they would not allow too many validators to come out of the chain at any single day. And at the same time, there are validators who are also getting into staking as I mentioned. I am taking a look at the dashboard by Metrica which is supported by Ethereum. So, if we can take a look here, you can see that as validators are coming out, they are also getting in so security is there. The loop is closed, which means the function is working properly. So I think people will be getting confident only instead of losing that and when they decide to come out you know, they also have limited options.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat they can do with the Eth they want to take out either they can trade it to you know, get into some other cryptocurrency or in cash that or they can keep it in their own wallet like E-wallet but there's no point keeping it with them in their wallet and not doing anything with that. There is another option that is coming up is like staking with the help of a liquid staking pool. That's another option. But again, with a liquid staking pool, people will also come as validators into the system. So yeah, I don't see a threat yet. Obviously there, there's a lot of confidence getting in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. And for those on the call, who are perhaps less familiar with Ethereum and ETH staking, can you talk a little bit about what the incentives are for people to keep their Ether staked even now that the Shapella upgrade is complete?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, the minimum requirement is if you want to become a solo staker, of course, the minimum requirement is 30 ETH that you have to deposit on the network. However, if you do not have the study of ETH, there are multiple options available in the ecosystem. You can go with as I mentioned, like the liquid staking pools. So, for becoming a solo staker also, you need to have a set of, you know, technical help also to run both nodes execution node and consensus node on your own like on your on your home or wherever you want to do that and make sure that they are online at all points of the network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, if you are not technically skilled enough to participate in the network as a solo staker, you can definitely take advantage of the staking services provided there are different kinds of staking services liquid staking is quite popular, because that also gives you the advantage of making use of the Eth while you have already staked like there are like they provide a token that pool token that you can be using in place of ETH. So there are other services, I think going with the services is a good way to get involved and make money. But if you want to make a real contribution and want to learn the network more, it would be a good idea to do solo staking. There are 10 clients available, five on the execution side and five on the consensus side. And they all have discord channels, they are willing to provide all kinds of support. So that's always less risky. But yeah, there are multiple options people can use.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGot it. And do you anticipate the unlocking of staked Ether and the rewards that will be paid out is going to attract intensified regulatory pressure from the SEC or how do you think about that and the change that just happened?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp; We are aware Kraken and Coinbase are definitely having some regulatory pressure right over there. But I am not sure if that's because of the unlocking of ETH that could be with their process like the way they would like to operate in the United States. This depends on the government. But I highly doubt that locking unlocking will in any way affect the government policy over here because locking unlocking is an individual's choice and if they are participating in a blockchain that depends on the government of that location where he or she is living, right? So I don't think they’re interrelated. That's what I meant to say here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. All right. So zooming out a little bit, just into kind of Ethereum’s journey more broadly. How does this upgrade position Ethereum for more long term success and mainstream adoption?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So, as I was mentioning, like Ethereum, proof of stake was kind of a dream for Ethereum people who started them back in 2015. They always wanted to have proof of stake. It took time like it took a lot of years to be here. Finally, we are having a full cycle of Ethereum validators here. I think now we have a complete system built up. Now what we need to do is improve the present system. We need to improve the present blockchain and that's what is our next priority.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the next upgrade that we are hoping to have would be based on scaling obviously, the proposal, inactive discussion and maybe ready for dev nets as well is EIP 4844. That will help layer two projects to maybe interact with the chain and be able to scale Ethereum transactions as well. So that's next.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think there could be few other improvements to be done. We would probably propose builder separation to try to make it more decentralized to the set of validators, proposers, relayers so we can make sure that security is never at threat. But if we talk about a system and ecosystem that can be, you know, running in parallel or the present ecosystem, Ethereum blockchain has already provided that with the Shapella upgrade.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. And zooming out a little bit more to kind of more of the mainstream adoption piece, do you believe that Ethereum will eventually surpass Bitcoin as the most dominant cryptocurrency and what do you think is still left? What would it take for that to happen?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSurpassing Bitcoin – that's an interesting question. I would like to share my take on that. So I believe that Bitcoin is the number one currency because of its total market price like shares that it contains, as well as the value that it has, right? But if you look at the user, you would see Etherum\u0026nbsp; has more distributed users. Multiple projects are running on top of Ethereum blockchain. Projects are trying to interact with Ethereum Blockchain. So I'm definitely confident here that Ethereum may, in the long run, be ahead of Bitcoin definitely in terms of user base.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePrice wise, it's hard to predict because a lot of things are associated with it. Ethereum transactions require gas, we are trying to figure it out and gas is again, the ETH there. So a lot of things to be taken care of. I am not in a position to talk about the price. But from users perspective and mainstream adoption. I think it's already ahead in the race.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, awesome. All right. Well, before we wrap up Pooja, anything else you'd like to share or anything else we should be aware of coming up for the Ethereum community?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would say that people need to be here, if we want this to be the most decentralized network. Ethereum has a good user base, but this contributor base can never be enough. We want the mainstream people to join us and for that they have to join and make the contribution in the way they can make. There are multiple opportunities Ethereum protocol gets into a lot of research – there are a lot of research findings going on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you would like to learn more about Ethereum, pick up the topics that people are working on. Join us as an intern. Ethereum also has this EPF - Ethereum Protocol Fellowship program, join those programs if you are a developer, if you are a researcher or a PhD institution, reach out to contribute your research work. There's a lot of opportunity to get involved. Obviously, you can make money by becoming validated and earning rewards as well. And trading is another thing, but you become a part of the network, by your way, the way you like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, look forward to what we are doing here. There's lots of new changes coming up as I was mentioning about 4844. Account abstraction is already out there EIP 4337 so wallet and these types of smart contract developers can start taking a look at this proposal and may implement it in their projects. There are a lot of opportunities out there. Stay tuned. All the best to everyone. I hope Ethereum will become a big success with the help of you all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Thank you Pooja and before we drop, if folks want to follow you, where can they follow you to hear more about what you're talking about with respect to Ethereum? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjam: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs I mentioned, I'm a part of Ethereum Cat Herders. So ETH Cat Herders discord is one of the best places where people can come and chime in and share their questions, comments, concerns related to Ethereum blockchain or Ethereum protocol. I'm also available on Twitter at poojaranjan19, so you can follow me on most of the social media Twitter, Telegram and all so yeah, I'm available there as well.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome - well thank you so much for being here and for talking about this very important upgrade with all of us.

So let's begin with the most obvious question, at least to me, why the need for something like Saga right now in the marketplace?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, if you've ever imagined what crypto should be like, once we actually get to full adoption, you can imagine that world with a phone that's not your hardware wallet, it just makes sense. Right? Like it's the device you use every day, it has all the technology necessary for signing and transactions to be secure. It's just not enabled yet. So myself, I spent most of my career at Qualcomm and some of my closest colleagues worked on the technology that we're using to enable this. They literally built the Snapdragon trust zone. So as soon as I started working on crypto, it was just always in the back of my mind, when are we going to enable this on a Qualcomm device. So I'm pretty excited to actually get this to market and the level of security that this provides, I think, is so close to what a mobile phone could do, in terms of being a hardware wallet. So I'm really excited to bring that to consumers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd to the point about bringing that to consumers. Talk to me about how you envision this new look, web3 experience to be especially on a device, an Android device and, and something like this for people who have some familiarity, but are pretty eager to learn more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we want to get the experience to be as kind of slick and exciting to people as and seamless as what you expect on an Apple Pay, or the Google Wallet. So when you sign transactions, you just tap the fingerprint scanner, and it automatically detects your fingerprint, does a biometric checking inside trusts out in a secure environment, and that signature happens and your transactions go through. The nice thing about doing this in Solana is that it's cheap and fast and it feels like you're using, you know, Google Wallet or Apple Pay as well. So you're own experience is kind of a slow network effect that you do on a theory or other networks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut there's more. I think one of the fundamental reasons why this is necessary isn't just the security part, it’s actually the applications part of the web3 DAP store that Solana released as well. There's a bit of a fundamental difference with web3 business models, that doesn't really work with web2. When you own web3 content, you actually own it. You own those NFTsYou know, when you own music that you bought from iTunes, you don't actually own that music. It's still Apple, so you can't transfer it. You can't sell it on eBay, right? You can't give it to your kids, in theory. But then NFTs, you can actually own those digital goods. So that just doesn't really quite work with the App Store models, like applications, like magic eaten in their iOS app, they can't list the digital items that are for sale in their marketplace, at 30%. higher price in the iOS App Store because they don't own that content. They can't eat those costs internally. And they can't list it higher because there's no way somebody's gonna pay $30,000 for an NFT in the Apple App Store, if it's available for 10,000 bucks on the desktop, that's just never gonna work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo there's a bit of a conundrum there. How do we get the app the big app stores to change those policies and to actually re-script to let these new business models, you know, be discovered and for people to figure out how to monetize them in a way that's fair to everyone. So I think we're taking that first step to really enable that for consumers and developers to see what happens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnatoly, was it always part of your your calculus or your dream to have a separate Solana App Store, especially given how the App Stores of today, Googles and Apples have very strict payment system rules and to your point, one of the big headaches for developers, of course, is this 30% figure and a lot of the rules and regulations under the companies that basically control the market share of the space, at least up until now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, you know, Solana is a platform. It's a platform for developers. So I talked to developers all the time, it's just kind of my day to day, probably half of my day is spent talking to external developers that are building some applications. And I would say their number one concern is how am I going to get these web3 features through the Google approval process for the Apple approval process? So as soon as we started gaining traction with devs, this was always something that they brought up. So immediately it became something that I've kind of always had in the back of my mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDo you expect web2 companies to try and do something like this? You did a good job a response or two or go laying out some of their challenges, but is it your expectation that even the web2 kind of legacy names will be forced to sort of adapt?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would love to work with every web tech company that's thinking about this, and with all the tech we built is open source, we will gladly work with them to do the engineering work for them to start leveraging this platform. That would be awesome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHave you, if you don't mind me asking, have you had any conversations with any of those names?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNothing deep that we want to announce yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay. All right. Fair enough. I'm a journalist. I'm just asking the questions I'm sure you understand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, give me your sense. Give me your sense about why this has not yet been done already and why is Solana the right foundation for mobile, and of course your for more mainstream adoption?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mean, it's probably because I'm the founder that worked at Qualcomm for over a decade. So I knew exactly what pieces of technology we needed to build to ship this. So it didn't take a 100 person team. It was a very small team of labs, you know, I think about five to seven engineers that we got the ball rolling to get this out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd Solana the network is really well suited for the mobile experience, users really can't wait, you know, 10, 20, 30 seconds, let alone minutes for transactions to settle. That has to happen within one to two seconds, and it has to be so cheap that for the mobile experience, developers can actually pay for the user.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo if the unit economics for using these web3 applications have to be so low that you can start doing the same kind of adoption, you know, product market fit loops that you see on mobile applications today. And that means users don't actually care about what network it’s running in- they don't deal with gas costs. And all that stuff is kind of hidden behind the scenes for them. And for that to be possible, the network has to be cheap, as fast as to be scalable. I think Solana is the only one that really fits that bill right now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAny close competitors you have who might launch a competing phone or something like that, not even on your radar just yet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's not even on my radar. Anonymously, everything we built is open source. I think we would love to get contributions from anyone on the Ethereum community or Bitcoin community to add support for those networks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhenever you talk about mobile pay operations, this opens the doors to a conversation for general security questions, security concerns. Talk to me about the assurances, and really the work that you and your team have had to do with regards to privacy considerations, especially for any person out there who might consider getting involved, but say, hey, when it comes to mobile pay operations, you're really dealing with some pretty intimate personal information.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as everybody knows, public permissionless networks are public by default. So any transactions that you do are recorded in a public ledger. So this is something that folks need to be mindful of. And there are technologies to make transactions more private, like elusive is a technology that does as your knowledge proof when you want to do transfers and things like that. So you would have to intentionally use those technologies. And because all of those are available as smart contracts, it is really outside of the hardware wallets kind of domain to take care of the wallet, the only thing that it provides is the secure signing capability. But everything else you can basically access via smart contracts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow many pre orders do you have on the phone? What does interest look like?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBefore we launched, we had about I think 5,000 pre orders, we were targeting developers and from my perspective, it was..our DBT units that we shipped are very well received. So we have a very excited developer community that loves the device.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo it sounds like that was largely your expectation about that 5,000 number. And again, keep in mind, it's early, right? We're not even quite yet at the shipping distribution phase of it, but you get the sense that that largely matches the excitement you had hoped for for people?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, so the thing is that like, I've worked on every major phone launch at Qualcomm, like as an engineer, remember the Amazon Fire the Metro phone from Microsoft. It's very, very hard to launch a phone with a million units sold on day one. And this is actually I think ..this was never our time, when you look at daily active users on\u0026nbsp; the most popular web3, networks like applications like OpenSea, it's about 10 to 20,000 people that generate 20 to $30 million of volume per day. So our goal is to actually get the most heavy web3 users on this device. And because there's no restrictions for web3 content on this device, that's a better distribution channel. If you can target those 10 to 20,000 users directly as an app developer, that's a much better distribution channel than the big app stores because of the restrictions. So that's really what matters. Can we get the right users?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd how about targeting users that may not yet be too involved with the web3 space? I think at this point, most people, if not everyone has heard of it. But as you know, not everyone has necessarily felt confident as of yet to dip their toe into the market. You do a great job laying out the case, I would argue in terms of going to that core constituency that you know, we'll be supportive. I think your pre-order numbers suggest that, but how about other people that are sort of on the sidelines? Is this something they might be able to consider, if not now, for potential future application?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is an awesome Android device on its own. It's built by an amazing company, the founder literally designed the iPad Pro. I mean, like when I worked at Qualcomm, and I would compare the phones that we had to iPhones and I was always like, why can't we have nice things. This is like the first phone that I feel like the build quality is better than Apple’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I would suggest that anyone that's like, loves phones and wants to check out Android, we've literally I think the first time that I've ever seen people tweet on Twitter, I'm going to switch from iPhone to an Android device because of this. So I would genuinely recommend that people go check it out simply because it's an awesome phone. And then maybe if they're curious about crypto, check out those features too.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnything like this is undoubtedly a huge labor of love. Talk to me personally, what most excites you? I can only imagine here, right, but just covering enterprise and covering big companies, and covering people with big ideas for a living. There's such an emotional part about this. It's such a deeply personal thing you and your colleagues are undoubtedly pouring all of yourselves into this. What most excites you personally about this, that you would want someone watching this interview to take away?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOh, man, yeah, we literally call it chewing glass. But the process of launching a product like this, we had to chew a lot of glass. What I love about it is I think all the ideas that we have, and all the dreams that we have about having this like full web3 adoption with privacy, and people with self custody, having full control of their funds, of their digital content, it's all kind of coming together. And it’s all.. the technology is there. It's possible, and the user experiences can be wonderful. It could be joyful, right? You're using Apple Pay or any other Google Wallet experiences, but now for crypto.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that to me is really, really exciting. And I want to see people that are so excited about the applications that this is the best reason that they get this phone. They're not just curious, but they actually see somebody that built something that gives them so much value that they want to go get this phone and then enjoy that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mean, you work in this space, you're on Twitter as much as I am, if not more - so you know, web3 has its fair share of critics. What do you say to people that may still be on the outside and not they're not on the outside, because they just haven't learned enough to get involved, they're on the outside because they have learned a lot and they are firmly in the camp of being adversarial to a lot of the efforts that you're describing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think their skepticism is very warranted and welcome. And I think it's going to take a lot of work for us to prove that there is real value here. And I think that's very fair to say, like we haven't yet seen an application and crypto in web3, that has broken out to consumer success that everyone's using it on a day to day basis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we're trying to kind of like remove all the speed bumps for developers to get there. And that's a lot of work in and of itself. But I firmly believe in the idea of self custody, that you own these cryptographic keys that are secured with math, and that gives you tremendous power to transact and coordinate with people online. It's a very powerful thing – it expands to human human rights, right? That's maybe a bit too much. There's much bigger problems in the world, but it does empower people to go do really cool things on the internet, so I think that's awesome and I'm excited to see the kinds of applications people build.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then talk to me a bit more about especially for people that are kind of accustomed to having a more traditional provider, let's say an AT\u0026amp;T or Verizon - what does this look like specifically with Helium 5G? First, a lot of mobile, especially if you're introducing some names that some people, not all of your demographic base, of course, but some people are only really learning about for the first time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I mean, if you're a wireless network nerd, this has got to be the coolest thing ever. Because, you know, all these massive networks, they're effectively almost like government mandated monopolies. These are very big companies. They require licensing from the FCC and a lot of work and deployment to go build, build these towers and deploy these towers and everything. And Helium is doing it from the ground up, basically volunteer driven, and people are doing it for tokens, which are like, you know, more or less doing it for fun, right? They want to see if this will actually work. And I believe Helium was at about 8,000 5G cells, and these are like four GCB, you know, 4G+ CBRS spectrum band cells, similar to what other folks call 5G as well. If you want to get technical, there's a bunch of differences, but it's a high quality network at like 8,000 cells. AT\u0026amp;T and Verizon, I think are about 50,000 cells.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe United States probably needs like a million. These are the estimates that I've seen before people talk about online. Some will say as high as 10 million to really get wall to wall coverage. So there's a lot of work left to do for the big carriers. And I think there's a very good chance that Helium passes them. And like overtakes and is maybe the first one to actually get to that, you know, 500,000 or a million number of like 5G cells in the United States. And that would be awesome. That means a bunch of volunteers coordinating with cryptography, right? Just with a bunch of math on a public blockchain, we're able to outpace in very critical infrastructure for United States for communication. I think that would be the coolest thing that's ever happened, I think in technology.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou told me earlier about the number of pre orders. Are you able to give me a sense about your own internal projections? How many of these are you hoping to sell? And what does that kind of long term base case look like?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would be super happy if we get 25,000 hardcore users that love this device. To me that's like, that's something that I know, developers that I talked to, would find very compelling as a distribution channel. And that's a good enough start. Obviously, it would be amazing if we were 10x that. And that would be awesome, but we'll see what happens. It's very hard to build phones, we build a really great device. But you know, it's very, very hard to sell phones. It's a very competitive market. So we'll see what happens. Startups are here to take big swings and take risk. That's what we're doing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, my man, you got to take big swings, you're swinging for the fences out there. If it were easy to develop a phone, truly everyone would do it, and there's a reason so few are. Finally, what would you most want either anything we didn't directly talk about or anything that kind of keeps you up that you would most want people to know about this new iteration for you and the company?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is a work of love from Solana labs, and another startup Awesome Privacy, that have really poured their heart into the hardware and the software.

I'm Sarah Evans, Founder and CEO of Sevens PR as always, it's important for me to acknowledge I am not an investing expert, but I am a passionate and gracious learner with a focus in the tech industry. Let's jump right in. Today with us is Ari Redbord, Head of Legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs to discuss crypto regulation and the road ahead in 2023. Thanks so much for joining us today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;Sarah, thank you so much for having me. Exciting to chat with you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I feel the same. I always learn so much. I joke that this is my informal master's degree in all topics.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo crypto regulation discussions have been at the top of agendas for regulators across the United States after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, leading to investors losses of close to $10 billion. This is a two part question for you. But we'll start with part one. Can you give us some insight on how regulators in the US seek to provide more revenue, literary clarity in a current chaotic industry?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's a great question and really pretty much the most important question today in the US. I will say sort of to start things out that globally, the landscape is a little bit different. We've seen regulators and even policymakers really around the world lean in to sort of digital asset regulation. Even just yesterday in Australia, we saw the Australian government come out with a framework that could potentially ultimately be sort of legal clarity for digital assets in Australia. We saw the same this week from the UK,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think the US is a little different, right? We haven't seen a lot of activity yet on Capitol Hill that could provide real legal clarity to businesses on key definitions, you know, what is a security versus what is a commodity when it comes to digital assets. What we have seen is a lot of activity out of the executive branch, right? We've seen an executive order on digital assets, we've seen a number of enforcement actions, there's been a bunch of sanctions actions by the Treasury Department against, you know, bad actors in the cryptocurrency space like Russia based exchanges, and dark net mixing services and other types of things. We've seen a lot of enforcement actions from the SEC. And finally, we've seen a number of different criminal prosecutions that have gotten a lot of headlines from the Department of Justice, quite frankly, including the SPF, and FTX case.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we've seen a lot of talk on Capitol Hill, but we definitely have not seen a lot of legislative activity. I'm hopeful that as we kick off 2023, we will see some activity. I still don't think a lot but hopefully at least around stable coins, which I think will be the first place we'll see some regulation, because there's some consensus around the fact that stable coins should be backed one to one in order to protect consumers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Thank you. That's really good insight. Although the FTX fraud was crypto related, much of their success in avoiding regulation came from the sheer fact that they were not based in the US. Should regulators be focusing on fixing international regulatory law instead of maybe blaming the crypto industry for the fraud?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, look, I think the nature of cryptocurrency, right? Cross border value transfer at the speed of the Internet means that there's got to be some consistent standards across different regulations. I'm not naive enough to think that we're gonna have some sort of global framework for crypto, but I think we could have some more consistency. And I think we're actually starting to see that build out. Even I mentioned, Australia and the UK this week, a lot of similarities between the two frameworks. And then you look at the EU, which really has led the way with mica, the markets and crypto assets, legislation, that is really the first clear, comprehensive framework for digital assets. So we're starting to see some consistency. But I think the reality is, you're going to have jurisdictional arbitrage, right? Bad actors. And businesses are going to look to jurisdictions where there's not regulation, and try to build there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I think, you know, I talked to a regulator recently, who said to me, Look, we're only as strong as our weakest link here. And that is absolutely true. I will say that the FTX is an example of the US sort of using that extra territorial jurisdiction or the fact that US users were on those platforms to really rein in a non US based crypto business and apply US laws. And I think you'll be able to see that as long as US consumers are engaging with these platforms globally - but there's no question it is harder.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. Crypto leaders like SPF were leading the way and giving a framework to governing bodies to provide a more straightforward path forward to regulation. After the shocking collapse of FTX, how has this affected previous regulatory plans in the space and part two, how has this affected other crypto leaders' influence within the US government?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, no, it's a great question. There's no question – I live in Washington, there's a lot more skepticism here around crypto than there was about FTX or the collapse of FTX. And I think a lot of this is almost starting from the beginning. I think quite frankly, what I was excited about for 2023 was a real focus on defy you know, how should we regulate or think about policymaking in a truly decentralized world, when we don't have intermediaries?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think that FTX has set that back. And the conversation has gone back to well, how do we regulate, you know, fraud in, in, in centralized exchanges? Like FTX? And I think the reality is, and I think you got to this a little bit with your question is, you know, the fraud and FTX did not occur on blockchains. This was not an issue of the technology. It was very much an issue of bad actors, the same as Lehman and Enron and other types of cases that have plagued the centralized financial system for really generations. And I think that there are laws in place today to deal with FTX. And I think we've seen a lot of those play out, right? Securities laws, fraud, civil and criminal statutes. And I think we'll continue to see more of that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think what I'm excited about is policymakers really talking about, you know, how do we regulate this cryptocurrency ecosystem differently? And I think we've pushed back, that timeline has been pushed back, because there's a lot of skepticism today in Washington.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm really glad you made the distinction between bad actors and bad technology. I think it's a really important distinction point. Moving on, there is much discussion on who will lead the way in crypto regulation in the US with Congress, the SEC, and the CTFC fighting for the head role. Can we expect a key regulatory figure in the industry? Or do you think new rules and laws will come from multiple governing bodies? And followed by could this dispute lead to a longer roadmap for new regulations in crypto?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I think it's probably the most important question facing the space today, because it's not just who's going to regulate. Businesses need that regulatory clarity in order to engage in the US. And I think we're not going to have that until we have our definitions straight. You know, what crypto assets are securities, which are commodities, you know, which are financial instruments, and sort of, and really sort of set out a framework. And I think the reality is, it's going to be some time before we have that. And what we're going to continue to see are these sort of, you know, people call it regulation by enforcement, it has sort of a negative connotation, but the reality is that regulators are going to act with the authorities that they have, and they don't have legislative authority, they have enforcement authority. So we're going to continue to see the SEC continue to take action and the CFTC continue to take action until there is clarity between sort of what is what is the commodity and what is the security? And \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo finish addressing your question, I think, ultimately, we will see different regulators play different roles in this ecosystem, you know, we don't have one financial regulator, as they do as the Monetary Authority of Singapore, for example, right? We've always had the Fed, the Treasury, the SEC, the CFTC, and I think they're all going to play a different hand in this, but we're going to need Congress to act and to the regulator's credit, they've all said that, right? The Fed, the SEC, the CFTC. They said, we need Congress ultimately to act and the White House, you know, can put out all the executive orders they want, but you're gonna need legislation eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, great point. Apart from the FTX collapse in 2022 many other platforms and projects experienced chaotic collapses, including stable coin, Terra Luna. In an industry where much regulatory clarity is necessary, what segment of crypto is at the top of regulators agendas? And when do you think we can expect to see the first set of crypto regulations in the US? I know, it's a big question.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's a big question and is a great question. And I think, you know, look, I think the collapse of Terra was really the first really global collapse of one of these sort of important crypto players. And it really caused the world, the EU, UK, Singapore, Dubai, and even the US to talk about how do we regulate the stable coin space in particular? And I think, as I mentioned at the outset, I think the one thing we may see this year from the US Congress is, is legislation on stable coins. And I think it's because A, they play an important part from the stability perspective and the ecosystem. But I also think it's the place that there's the most consensus on, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe industry, and policymakers pretty much agree that after Tara, you're going to need a one to one reserve backing of these stable coins with this sort of fiat or stable asset. And I think we're seeing that consensus. I thought we were going to have legislation come out of the House Financial Services Committee on this last Congress, but I'm hopeful that sort of early this Congress we’ll have something because that is really, really been a focus. So I think stable coins is probably the answer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEven if you look at the UK framework that came out yesterday, stable coins was in that sort of high risk category that regulators and policymakers are really focused on. So I think if there was one area, that would be it, but I think that there's probably a number of others that we could see discussion on. But I think, you know, look at post FTX, I still think we're in still this world of discussing the risks and the challenges with crypto, less about sort of what the the possibility of the technology, which is, quite frankly, what I think we should at least be talking about as part of this.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat. I do want to dig in also on what you do and TRM’s labs, how do they work to create a more compliant and safe place for users in an industry with numerous gray areas? I'm really interested.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, no, thank you so much for the question.\u0026nbsp; You know, look, the unique qualities of public blockchains, right? Transparent, traceable, immutable, allow regulators and law enforcement and crypto businesses to trace and track the flow of funds to monitor transactions in ways that were impossible in the fiat system. So what we do is we are a blockchain intelligence company at TRM and we work with law enforcement regulators to do investigations to track and trace the flow of funds using our software. And then we work with financial institutions and cryptocurrency business is really across the spectrum as an anti money laundering solution. You want to make sure that bad actors North Korea's terrorist financiers, cyber criminals are not engaging with your platforms and crypto businesses and financial institutions use our software as an anti money laundering solution.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, it's completely fascinating and Ari Redbord, I want to thank you so much for joining us today. He is the Head of Legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs, where can folks find you and the company online if they'd like to engage after this?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely.
