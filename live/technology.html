For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

I'm your host Anne Berry and today's show is brought to you by Tema ETFs. Joining us today as our guest is Yuri Khodjimurian, CFA and Chief Investment Officer at Tema ETFs, an issuer focused on bottom-up investing in unique structural themes like their toll, that's ticker T-O-L-L ETF. We're going to unpack that further. Yuri, welcome to the Public Podcast. Great to have you on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYuri Khodjamirian:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB\u003c/strong\u003e: Yuri, let's start right there with that lead-in and talk about the $TOLL ETF that you at Tema have launched and how that's indicative of the way that you approach investing as a team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, absolutely. I mean, $TOLL is probably an exemplary ETF of the kind of thematics that Tema is trying to bring to the market. I think a lot of thematic issuers often go for what I would term kind of more fatty type themes like artificial intelligence or what may you, that are more related to what I would call aggressive growth. At Tema, we're trying to be very thoughtful about kind of the companies that go into a particular theme and also the themes that have long-term durability. So $TOLL or the monopolies and oligopolies ETF, basically investing companies that operate in monopolistic or oligopolistic industries. And this is kind of, you've probably heard the Warren Buffett term moat. Think of this as kind of an ever-expanding moat with crocodiles in it that hopefully lasts rather than kind of a couple of years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd that's sort of the idea behind it. And it's all about quality companies within it, right? Rather than maybe necessarily going just for growth, which a lot of thematics tend to do. So I took a look at some of the companies that are listed. This is as of June 30th in the public disclosures, Yuri, you've got, I think your top two holdings as of that point in time, included the credit rating agencies, you've got S\u0026amp;P and Moody's in there. And then you've got a number of French industrial companies. I saw that your weighting's France, you know, France is about 15% as of that point in time. Take us through some of those names. Again, you've got the rating agencies. What are some of the others and why are they in your ETF at the size that they are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. I mean, look, what we're looking for are companies that operate in an industry that is essentially either has one, two, or three players maximum, which are concentrated where there's essentially monopolistic or oligopolistic structure. So if you take the credit rating agencies, there are three in the entire world. And in fact, really there are two, S\u0026amp;P and Moody's effectively control most of the market between them. There's also Fitch, but it's a kind of smaller player, more distant kind of third player in that market. Similarly, with the French industrial company, so we own Airbus, which is a manufacturer of airplanes. And as we all know, there are only two manufacturers of airplanes in the world. There's Airbus and Boeing. And so we've gone for Airbus in our portfolio. Essentially that kind of gives you a flavor of the types of industries we're looking for, right? Two players really concentrated market share between those two players. And that creates a lot of really fascinating dynamics because one, we believe that this industry structure is going to maintain for a very long time. So if you take aerospace, right, what you get there is this is a highly regulated industry. It takes forever and costs a lot of money to develop a new airplane. People have tried different manufacturers before, but nobody's really succeeded apart from Airbus and Boeing. And that's because safety is really important. It takes ages to certify and test a plane and to develop one to make a lot of money. And so that's the kind of durability of that monopoly that we think will endure over a long, long period of time. And it's a similar thing with credit rating agencies. What's happening with them is they get as they rate more and more companies, they get more and more data and information about other companies. And that maintains their advantage because for competitors to come in and recreate that database, it's going to be very, very difficult to do. That advantage maintains for a long period of time and in it creates really fascinating kind of financials, which we think benefits the stock price over the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's talk about that, Yuri. Is it necessarily the case that having a high amount of concentration in an industry does translate into, for example, decent growth, not use the term aggressive growth for some of the other companies out there? Let's just say decent growth for these companies, above average margins, strong free cash flow. Are those characteristics you always see in the kinds of industry structures that you're talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I mean, it's a fascinating question, right? I think what the most important metric where it kind of comes out is probably return on invested capital, which is a moniker of high quality companies. So all of the companies that operate in monopolistic industries tend to have higher returns on invested capital. Now, obviously, you know, our funds tries to select the best monopolies, ones where there's sort of durable advantage over a long period of time. And that means that necessarily maybe you'll have a monopoly where you have high returns, but the companies don't say invest in a new innovation and squander that advantage. And over time, industry structure collapses because new competitors come in. Because remember, it's a competitive capitalistic market, right? So people are always trying to go after this high, they see these high returns are like, oh, I could have a piece of that. And they try to enter. And so what we're looking for are monopolies that are very strong, right? They're taking some of these cash flows and not instead of enriching their shows or reinvesting back into their business and creating stronger and stronger modes. And that's why you can't just kind of pick a few of these companies and hold them over the long term. You want to be able to spend a lot of time analyzing and understanding the ones that are going to be very durable over a long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eYuri, walk us through a couple of the factors that create these monopolistic or oligopolistic structures in the first place. Regulation is one, you've already pointed to that with respect to Airbus. What are other sources, create of the kinds of moat you're talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, exactly. And that kind of gets to the heart of what a monopoly is, these sources of competitive advantage. And if you read the industrial economic literature, or you know, you've sort of been in the stock market and look at businesses for long enough, you can kind of find five major sources of competitive advantage. Regulation is one. So think maybe even patented pharmaceuticals or some of these things that I've talked about in the aerospace area, you have a high switching costs. So that is if a customer there's an extreme cost for me to switch. Aerospace is a perfect example of that, right? Once these parts are certified, for example, if you're a supplier to Airbus, like we own an engine manufacturer, once that engine's been certified on that plane, it's going nowhere. It's not gonna be replaced by a competitor anytime soon. And that high switching cost is effectively why the monopoly persists over a long period of time. Then we have network effects. So that is where an additional user added to the network, creates so much value for the other users, it grows the value of the whole network for everyone who uses it. And a perfect example of that is a financial exchange, right? The more people trade on a financial exchange, the more liquidity there is, the higher the value to any individual user. And that network effect builds up a big value for that particular monopolistic industry like exchange. We can get onto how those dynamics play out over time in some other industries like tech. You also have economies of scale. So that is where how you build up enough sufficient scale that the individual unit cost of production goes down so much that no competitor can come in and compete with you. Semiconductor manufacturing is a perfect example of that. There are only a few companies that can manufacture the most leading edge semiconductors, which are by the way the most efficient way of manufacturing semiconductors. No one can compete with them on cost per transistor. And so therefore you have this advantage that other people can't get and it will take a very, very long time for them to reach, created almost impossible in some cases. And then the final one is kind of non-replicable physical assets. So this is where you have a physical asset in the physical world that you can't create again. Railroad is a perfect example of that. In the United States, you currently have six class one, which is large railroad companies, that effectively divide the whole country between them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. What's an example of that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK:\u003c/strong\u003e...building, recreating that railroad network is virtually impossible. I mean, you'll never get the permission for what you will. And so, you know, one thing you can almost say with certainty is that in 30 years, it will be the same railroad companies that are around us now. Exactly, you can't replicate those particular assets over time. And so you've effectively created a, sometimes people refer to in the literature as a natural monopoly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eIf we're not flying around, they're not going away any time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eSo those would be like the five forces, right? Regulation, high switching costs, economies of scale, network effects, and non-replicable physical assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's dig into one sector that has shown elements of those, you know, some of the five, not all of the five, but just gets a ton of coverage as a result. And that's the tech sector. And, Yuri, when we think about even the fact that the Magnificent Seven, right, is called the Magnificent Seven, there's a number around, there are acronyms around it, shows at least when it comes to capturing share of the public exchanges as concentration. And often that's because those companies themselves have achieved some of those monopolistic or oligopolistic benefits that you've described. Social media is one of those sub-sectors of tech where we see this kind of concentration in terms of the numbers of players. Let's dig into that a little bit. I mean, talk a little bit about what made those monopolies as clearly network effects, but why has it been so hard to disrupt the social media space?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's fascinating. I mean, we get asked about the technology sector a lot because, you know, obviously spending a lot of time looking and understanding where monopolistic industries, we're actually of the view that the technology sector is very difficult to actually say there are real durable long-term monopolies. And remember, I'm talking decades here and not necessarily the kind of a couple of years or even 20 years for that matter. And the reason for that technology is almost synonymous with disruption, right? And so sometimes you'll have what might appear monopolistic structures, but suddenly some new technology will come along and completely disrupt and change the whole paradigm. Yeah, so TikTok's a perfect example of that. One of the fascinating things about TikTok, if you dig into its history, is that one point in 2018, TikTok was taking 25% of all Facebook ads on iOS devices in the United States. I mean, just let that sink in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eLike TikTok. Like TikTok just came into that, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eA quarter of every four ads, one of them was a TikTok ad. This was when TikTok was nothing. So they used Facebook's network to build their own business and the results were staggering, right? I mean, if you look at the number of minutes people, especially younger people use and spend on TikTok versus Instagram or Snapchat, it's just, you know, the charts gone this way, right? And they built this advantage by using Facebook's network that Facebook has effectively given to them through these advertising dollars. And this speaks to another really interesting point about media and social media in general. They're all competing for our time, right? And time is actually quite a limited resource if you think about it. We all have how much you work or if you're Elon Musk, you have many more hours or whatever. You have 18, let's call it, or 16 hours in the day. If you're not sleeping that much, that's it. And that's what these media companies are competing for. And so that attention means that it's a much more competitive market than a market for dollars or freight or whatever it might be that kind of has infinite potential to keep growing and get bigger. The other side to this is advertising, right? Because what they're trying to do, these businesses, especially in the tech space, is they're trying to go for advertising dollars. And what I've found fascinating over the last kind of five years is companies that you would not necessarily associate with advertising have chosen advertising as their kind of new revenue stream. And the reason I bring this up is if everyone's converging on the same advertising dollars, that makes that pool of advertising dollars much more competitive than any other pool of money around. So if you take like Uber or Instacart or Amazon, you know, if you look at a typical Amazon page right now, most of that page are advertisement that other people have paid for. That to me is telling me that advertising dollar is not going to Google or Facebook, it's going to Amazon. And o it creates this competition and suddenly Uber is advertising on the app and Instacart is advertising retail when you're trying to buy your groceries. And so you're competing for the same dollars because it's a limited amount. Sure, it's growing, but it's a limited amount of money that you have. And that's why we think these areas like social media and search and kind of software are probably a lot more competitive than people give them credit for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's interesting to dig into something that you almost said in passing there, Yuri. It feels like the ad dollars going to the Amazon and the Instacarts and the Ubers is because the advertisers know that there's at least a moment in that very precious thing that you identified, which is time. But there are eyeballs captive and concentrating, right? They're moving away from a social media tab or they're moving away from watching streaming or whatever it is we're doing to actually focus on that transaction and that point in time. So Yuri, when you look ahead, when you look into a crystal ball, and it's an unfair question, which is always the most fun kind of question, where do you see new platforms coming up in the tech space that are going to be successful in capturing my attention in yours? And perhaps it's not necessarily clear they're doing it yet. They may sneak up on us, but where do you have a sense that you've got some emerging players in that space?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's really interesting. I mean, I think what's coming out of this conversation, at least in our minds when we analyze these markets, is one thing I can tell you for certain, there's something's gonna come, right? The disruption that happens in the tech sector, it's kind of synonymous with its kind of existence and its nature. So I don't know specifically what platforms are gonna come up, but they certainly will come up, right? So we've had a wave of virtual reality, right? That could be a new thing, right? Remember, the metaverse two years ago, everyone was talking about that. Now, I think these things always go through a hype cycle in technology, right? They get hyped up, everyone talks about it, gets excited. Usually a really bad ETF launch is related to it. And suddenly the excitement dies off and suddenly we... But the technology doesn't go away and people keep working on it and keep analyzing and keep thinking of new ways. And suddenly it's on the scene. And remember, this disruption keeps happening faster and faster, right? Take the example of chat GPT. Now, it took chat GPT five days to get to a million users, right? Instagram, for example, two and a half months to get to that same number. And if you look at historic kind of services or platforms, as you say, that are vying for our attention or our time or our use in the technology space, they're progressively getting faster and faster and faster in terms of how quickly they come and capture our imagination or our use. And that's the nature of the technology sector. That just doesn't happen anywhere else, right? No new railroad is gonna pop up in the US all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's dig into that and go, let's go full circle here in the conversations as we close out together, which is to that point, $TOLL, the ETF that you and the team have put together specifically to find the winners where there are monopolistic or oligopolistic characteristics. If I look at your top 10 holdings, you don't have a lot of tech in there and you don't have any in your top five. So if we go back to those five sources of competitive or monopolistic advantage that you identified earlier, Yuri, again, network effects, switching costs, economies of scale, regulation, nonreplicable physical assets. I know you've written a blog about this. It feels like listening to you as though you can almost rank them in your mind, right? Because the technology of social media play that we discussed is very heavy on network effects, right? There's a huge amount of reliance on that for those monopolies. Am I hearing or furring that perhaps the nonreplicable physical assets Monopolies are sort of your favourite in that line up. Maybe regulations, is there a way that you order them? And again, I'm just trying to play back to you what I've heard in the course of our conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. I mean, that's how we think about constructing monopolies. We always think, like, what are these sources? Can I identify these sources? And more importantly, are they really durable? And I think physical assets always is kind of the contrarian statement here, right? Because very few people associate technology with something physical in this world. But that's really where we are finding kind of the monopolistic businesses. So take, for example, semiconductor equipment manufacturing. These are companies that have spent a very long time developing some very, very advanced technology. And over time they've concentrated so that in certain processes within semiconductor manufacturing, there might be only two companies that do this in the whole world. In fact, it actually houses the one absolutely true monopoly that exists in technology, which is a Dutch company called ASML. Now, ASML builds the leading edge lithography machines for semiconductor manufacturing. And just to give you a sense of what this is. It's a four, three, four story machine. Okay, it's three to four stories high. It costs $300 million. It has a sphere of glass in it that if you were to blow it up to the size of the earth, it wouldn't have a dent less than sort of like one centimeter in it. It's like perfection of technology. And ASML is the only company in the whole world that can do this. It's taken it years to develop this stuff and it's selling it to its customers. It's a hundred percent monopolist in this space. But again, it's a physical thing that they've created and built. And that's why we think that that's an interesting area where there's not that much competition in the technology space. The other areas where you can combine the digital space with something tangible, like a support work, or as you said, regulation. So we quite like the tax preparation software space. You think that that's related to, you know, a technology, but actually to get taxed, you need a support network of individuals who are experts in tax. Over time, that support network is really what drives the value of that particular software and the competitive advantage versus any new entry that might come in. And that's where we think kind of the real, maybe gems, hidden gems in technology of monopolies are, and probably not in the...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's fascinating. Let's talk a little bit about that tax preparation one, because H\u0026amp;R Block, you know, would be an example of that, Uri, but this is also one where just to push you a little bit, the IRS has at least announced, we'll have to see how quickly it rolls out, that it wants to have its own e-filing, you know, and software offering out there to make it more accessible to taxpayers. Is that something, is that a scenario where you could almost say, oh, look, the regulator is disrupting the provider?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's really interesting because obviously one of the things that happens in monopolistic type industries, which tax preparation, there's only a few players actually, the one we own is Intuit, not H\u0026amp;R Block. And H\u0026amp;R Block is a bit more in the old world of actual physical tax preparation in terms of people going into offices, which we think the best. Exactly. It is a support network, but there's no technology attached to it. So for me, what I like about Intuit is you have the technology of tax preparation, but you also have a call center and real support helping people prepare these taxes. The IRS, so governments is something we have to watch very carefully always in the monopolistic space because one, governments often don't like monopoly power. Now, all the monopolies that we invest in, sometimes they get, you know, people think that they're bad, but the truth is they've arisen because they've given a lot of value to customers over time. And if we pick the right ones, they're the ones that have not necessarily taken a huge cut of this particular value and the customers have accrued most of it. The IRS obviously looks at this and says, well, Intuits created a ton of value for people to prepare their taxes, but we think there should be a, you know, the government should also allow easy filing because we have all of the information. Then there was a bill passed, some money was spent on this and investigate the report. It's expensive for them to create that system. There's a lot of political, like, fighting over this particular thing, because in general in the United States, there's a view that the government, it's taking your taxes. Should it really be telling you how you file your taxes as well? So it's a big political divide. And so in general, what I see there is quite a limited risk. They already have free filing. So for individuals who have very simple tax returns, they can file for free with the IRS anyway. Exactly. And so the question is, why? And it's not like tax preparation software is that expensive. It's a couple hundred dollars. So is it really worth the government's resources? And what's happened is that you've seen the IRS bill actually defund this particular area. So the risk is starting to go away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting. So many interesting insights coming out of this conversation.

And today's show is brought to you by Gambling.com Group. Joining us as today's guest is Charles Gillespie, who is the CEO at Gambling.com Group. And a little bit about Gambling.com Group, they're a provider of digital marketing services for the online gambling industry. I'm so excited to have Charles here on the Public Podcast today to talk about earnings. It's certainly been a busy couple of weeks for the company and certainly for Charles. So super grateful to have you here. and hear a little bit more about how this last quarter went for you. So thank you so much for joining me today, Charles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharles Gillespie: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks, Kinsey. My pleasure. We've got a great Q2 in the bag, so happy to answer all your questions about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course. Yeah, let's jump right in. You know, you mentioned that we had a great Q2. It was last week that Gambling.com Group. And one more time, that ticker is $GAMB. You released your second-quarter earnings. There were some pretty big numbers in there. One that certainly stuck out to me was that revenue grew 63 percent. So I'd love to hear your perspective on how that increase came to be. Tell me a little bit more about some of the factors that influenced that growth in revenue of 63 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, as many of your listeners will know, online gambling, in particular sports betting in the United States, has really kind of exploded over the last couple of years. And that's what drove the increase. So we grew North American revenue by 115% to 13.4 million. So that's over half of our nearly 26 million in revenue for the quarter. And that's where pretty much all the growth came from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo as sports betting and online gambling has become more popular, I would love to understand a little bit better how you differentiate yourself from what I imagine is a growing cohort of competitors. Tell me a little bit more about what that strategy is for differentiation in an industry that is growing at a pretty rapid clip across the board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, we differentiate ourselves from the other publicly traded companies in the United States in the online gambling industry by simply having a different business model. We are not an online gambling operator like Fanduel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars, et cetera. Those companies are actually our clients. So as you see them advertise everywhere they can and try to grow those businesses, they're spending a chunk of that money with us. And therefore we are growing much faster than the market in the United States, but we essentially offer investors a way to play the secular growth in online gambling in the United States without having to pick a winner. You know, is it going to be DraftKings? Is it going to be Fanduel? Well, it's going to be all of them actually. But where, you know, we will have a very nice business in the U S regardless of who ends up at the top of the pile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I'm curious about with all this being said that you have this unique perspective having exposure to some of the other bigger players in the space, in the gambling space, the online gambling space specifically. Tell me a little bit about what areas of the industry you're paying the most attention to right now. You know, that could be any particular sort of pockets of the market that you're watching, especially just as we're headed into the back half of Q3 and the rest of this year. Are there any parts of the online gambling industry that have been growing really quickly, that have been catching your attention, that you are feeling ready to share about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eSure, yeah. The main thing that's driving a lot of our business and the other companies in our space in the US is these new state launches. The next new state to launch is Kentucky. They're going live with sports betting on September 28th. So for us, that's mainly a Q4 phenomenon. We'll get three days of revenue in Q3, but it's really gonna hit us in Q4. We updated our guidance last week when we released earnings and the way we manage these new states is we don't add in the effects from these new state launches until the launch specifics are crystal clear, which in the case of Kentucky, they now are. So we added Kentucky into the guidance for revenue and in particular that took us to a range of 100 to 104 million. So we now expect to generate on the low end, 100 million in revenue this year. The next state that's gonna go live is North Carolina, which is very exciting for us because we're actually from North Carolina. Me and the co-founder, Kevin, were both born and raised in Charlotte, both went to UNC, and Kevin now lives back in Charlotte running our North American team. So North Carolina is gonna be fantastic for us when it finally comes online. There's no launch specifics yet, although we estimate it'll be Q1 of next year. And therefore it's not in our guidance. Well, we haven't actually introduced any guidance for 2024, but, you know, the way the analysts are modeling things out, you know, we've been clear not to add in any of these new states and as in when we get specifics on the, on the launch in North Carolina, we'll quantify that and, and that should show up in the analyst reports.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right. And in terms of state-by-state legislation, I'm curious about how the momentum feels right now. Does it feel positive? Does it feel like there are any big headwinds in terms of legislation to legalize vetting in these states? And with that in mind as well, what are your thoughts on anything at the federal level? Are there any expectations that you have around that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. My hope and prayer at the federal level is that they do absolutely nothing. This has become, and it frankly always was, a state's rights issue. And if the feds come in and actually try to do anything, it could be great or it could be horrible. If they mess it up, they mess it up for all 50 states, which from the kind of industry's perspective, that's putting your eggs in one basket. We're quite happy to have everything done on a state-by-state level because that allows for more variance. Certain states can try different things, different models work better than others. At the state level, they fix their mistakes much more quickly than at the federal level. So to the extent a state regulates online gambling in a kind of boneheaded way that doesn't help anyone, then they can go and fix it the next year. So we're quite happy with that state-by-state approach. You've already got over 25, over half the US has got regulated online sports betting. The next wave we expect will be online casino games. You've got a handful of states now that have online casino games, but that's really where our business will take a big leap forward. If you think about the profitability of online casino versus online sports betting, it mirrors what you see in a land-based casino. Okay. If you walk into a casino in Las Vegas, the sports book is tiny and there's a football field or two worth of, of slot machines. Uh, and, you know, that's for obvious reasons. They make a lot more money off the slots than they do off of the sports book. And it's no different online. Uh, so as we get new States coming online for online casino, that's, you know, really the heart and soul of our business, we do very, very well with sports betting, but we have historically done even better with these online casino games. And when I say that, I mean, helping people find online casinos, right? You know, again, we are the comparison shopping site to help people find these sites, we don't actually operate the online casino games ourselves, but, you know, we bought casinos.com, the domain name at the end of last year, which from our perspective is the single most desirable domain name to have in the industry. We relaunched that in July. So there's a brand new website up and running at casinos.com. And we think that'll be a big part of our growth over the next several years is that becomes as big as gambling.com in time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's certainly interesting to think about how sports betting, to your point, being available legally in half the country right now might sort of lay the framework for the scaling of online gambling in a more pure-play sense of the word. How does that manifest in your business? You know, tell me a little bit about how the experience with sports betting over the last couple of years has informed any plans to scale into the online gambling space once that becomes the conversation du jour as we're talking about legalization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. Well, you know, our corporate history is we kind of come from the online casino side. So we, I wouldn't say we've learned a whole lot about online casino over the last several years. More than we've learned about online sports betting is that's become a very meaningful part of our business. But if you look at it from the political standpoint in the US of actually regulating these activities, there's a pretty clear path. So step one, they regulate retail sports betting, you know, not online. You have to walk into a physical store somewhere, interact with a human or some sort of kiosk, and then you can make your sports bet. They realize after they do that, that they completely miss their revenue targets in terms of what they expected to make off of regulating that new activity because it doesn't scale. It's an individual location. Maybe there's a couple locations, but it doesn't have the same economics at all as an internet-based business. States will then come back to it and they'll add on online sports betting after having started with retail. Then they make a bit more money. It, you know, they become, they make some meaningful progress toward their revenue objectives for regulating online gambling, but they're still not there. So the next thing they then do is regulate online casino games. You know, in one state having this conversation right now is New York. You know, they, there were semi-serious conversations earlier this year about the prospect of actually regulating online casino games in New York and, um, you know, New York's a big state. It's, uh, it's, it's going to really move the needle when they finally do that. Uh, but these conversations, they take a couple of years, you know, the first time someone proposes this, it doesn't even get off the ground, but then they propose it next year. And people actually take it a little more seriously and they have a proper debate, but it doesn't go all the way through. And then the third year, yeah, they're more familiar with the issue. They've heard some of the arguments before. It's not as scary as it used to be. And it makes, you know, you can make a real push at actually getting this stuff approved. So, you know, just because you get a state considering, you know, online casino and it not going through. It's actually a sign of progress. And, and, uh, in time, we think quite a few, if not. The majority of states in 10 years will actually regulate online casino games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly some very interesting insight to consider the sort of the growth curve, right? So, you know, you mentioned Kentucky in the back half of this year, potentially North Carolina in early 2024. What else would you like to share with investors as you head into Q3 and beyond? Anything else that's top of mind right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, the start of football is a big deal for us and the rest of the industry. You know, we've got a lot of great assets out there, but one of the newest assets that we have is the usatoday.com website. So we've cut a strategic media partnership with Gannett, the company that owns the USA Today. They're also the incidentally, the largest publisher of newspapers in the United States. And what we do there is we help them monetize online gambling, sports betting and casino in exactly the same way that we do with gambling.com and our other websites. So for USA Today, if you go to usatoday.com/betting, that's us. That's our content, our technology, our advertising, all of it. And what we do there is create that compelling content, put it onto the usatoday.com website. We help them. We help Gannett drive a new audience into the website as well, a high-intent audience, users that are keen on opening up new sports betting accounts. And then we monetize it. Basically, we pass that traffic along to the operators under our commercial agreements, and we share the economics with our media partner, Gannett in that case. We've done a lot of work on that to get that ready for the start of the NFL. And that deal was only announced at the beginning of this year. So it's a relatively new deal, and we expect to kind of see it come into its own in September and in Q4 with NFL. Obviously, that's one of the biggest drivers of engagement in sports betting, and in particular in setting up these new accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, well, certainly an exciting time to have this chat. And it has been so wonderful to hear a little bit more about how Q2 was, and what the expectations are for Q3 and beyond. So Charles, thank you so much for joining me today. I really appreciate your time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's great to be here Kinsey.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant and I am so excited to be here with you today. Now before we jump in, I'd like to thank our sponsor, SinglePoint. SinglePoint ticker S-I-N-G on OTC Markets is a renewable energy and sustainable lifestyle provider. And we're thrilled that they made today's interview possible. Now today we are going to talk about a majorly hot topic that has been driving and yes, pun intended, plenty of conversation in business and investing in recent years, electric vehicles. I'm so happy to welcome our guest today. itselectric CEO, Nathan King. Nathan, welcome to Public. How are you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNathan King: \u003c/strong\u003eHi, Kinsey, I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course, I'm thrilled to have you here we have a lot to cover. And I'm excited to learn a little bit more about what you're doing, what your business is doing, what your vision for the future of electric vehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure is. And I think as we get started with that conversation, it would be good to start with a little bit of context. itselectric is a startup that's building a new model for EV charging stations. But I gather, that's just the beginning. So Nathan, could you start by telling me a little bit more about your business? And about the challenge for which you're solving?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. So itselectric is an EV charging company, and we're exclusively focused on cities. And why is that important? Well, there are at least 40 million drivers in the US that parked their cars on city streets, they don't have access to an off street, parking garage or a driveway. And the beauty of what we do at itselectric, is we allow that very urban density that creates barriers for EV charging in cities actually to become our solution. And what we do is simple. We find spare electrical capacity at the adjacent privately private property and we pull that electrical supply out to the curb side to power an EV charger for any driver in the community parks their car on the city street. Why would a building owner let us do this? Well, what we do is we share revenue from that charger back with the host property. There's no upfront cost to the owner. itselectric pays for all the electricity that we use. And even with a low or modest utilization that host property can earn around $1,000 a year. So it's really it's a win win for for everyone involved. The host property can bring EV charging to the community. EV drivers now have an opportunity to have a place to charge where they're already parking their car. And for cities. This is a privately funded solution. So we don't have to requisition money from city budgets or state budgets to get EV charging. Infrastructure deployed. Right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo using what's already they're using what's already there exactly. Got it. And I gather that this is kind of part of the the solution to one of the bigger question marks or one of the bigger problems that a lot of people who have tried to understand EVs or at least how we get to mass adoption of electric vehicles. One of the big things that we talk about is range anxiety, that that feeling of not really knowing how long you can go not knowing if you're going to find the appropriate kind of port to charge or know all of that anxiety that comes along with can I make it where I need to go? Will I be able to pull over and do what I need to do? Tell me a little bit more about how that range anxiety is, is coming to life in these urban areas where you're deploying your tools and your business. Tell me a little bit more about how range anxiety plays out for people in those more densely populated parts of our country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eSure, and and, you know, we acknowledged that range anxiety is going to be something that drivers think about, they imagine themselves stranded in between two cities and not able to find a charger. But because we're a sort of city focused EV charging, we're actually concerned with something that we call accessing anxiety. So if you don't have anywhere that you can find a charger to plug in and in charge your car, you're going to think twice before you buy an electric vehicle so that that access anxiety actually becomes your primary consideration before you buy an EV. And, you know, most drivers and cities, they don't put that many miles on their cars, and they use their cars for their daily commute. They're not really driving from city to city. And so really what they're doing is they're, they want to be sure that they have a convenient and accessible location to charge their car when when they need to. We we know from the Department of Energy that about 80% of the electricity that powers EVs is done at home. So a typical EV driver, they'll have their own garage or driveway, they'll have an electrician come in and put a decent charger so that they can charge their car overnight. That's, again, that's 80% of how charging is done in this country. And that other 20% are when people are driving long distances, like I said, in between cities, or maybe they happen to go shopping, and they go to a public charger, and they hop off their car if they're having a busy day. But really the easiest way and the most convenient way. And the big advantage around EVs is that you don't have to go somewhere to fuel your vehicle, you plug in, let it charge overnight. And when you come out in the morning, you're you have a full you have a full battery. So that kind of charging behavior is what we want to unlock and enable for city drivers. It shouldn't just be a luxury that drivers and suburbs have.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely certainly certainly makes a lot of sense. And I would love to hear a little bit more about the community focused approach. You mentioned that this feels like a win win for both the drivers of EVs for the cities where we want more EVs to be on the roads, and also for the communities where you're entering into, you know, their their market their neighborhood. Tell me a little bit more about how you're trying to align incentives with these local communities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, you know, this is, this is a little bit comes from my background, before starting It's electric. I work as an architect and I worked on big complicated projects, in cities across the US. And one of the things that we learn as architects is that if you are building a big project, in a particular neighborhood, it's disruptive to the people that live there. And so you really need to make sure that you have some buy in from the community before you start that project. And you know, architects do this by making sure that the buildings that they design fit the context of the neighborhood, they make sure that they're in many cases, that there are things that are set aside in the actual building for the community to use, you know that that's like a, like a community center, or a place that people can gather and or cafe to eat. If you don't have that buy in from the community, when you're working on an urban project, your project will get slowed down, or it might not happen at all. And so we really tried to bake that understanding into how we think about its electric and put that into our business model. And so this idea that actually, we're going out and working and making partners with property owners in the communities that we're working with, that's how we are trying to sort of engage the engage the community directly, people who are hosting our chargers are literally our partners in that deployment. The other thing that we've learned is, is that the design of what we're doing is very important. So I mentioned, it needs to fit the context of the city that we're working in. So our chargers are actually designed to be very minimal. We don't have really an EV charging company in this country right now, that has designed something to fit and operate exclusively on a city street. What we have in this country are things can look like gas pumps, communities aren't really going to want to see things like that from their homes and businesses. So in order for us to scale up, EV charging, it really needs to be small, it needs to be compact, it needs to be durable, and it needs to fit in with the existing landscape. So that's our that's really important for us as well. We're designed and community focused approach to evey charging, yeah, certainly makes a lot of sense.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd one question that I would love to get your perspective on because this is quite frankly, something new that I didn't understand. I live in New York City, I don't have a car I rarely drive but you know, it's it's something that I have only done once been in a car that has had to pull over in charge on the way down from upstate one of those long city to city drives. But I didn't know that there are certain types of cars that can only types of EVs that can only charge at certain kinds of chargers. And this idea of interoperability is still a question mark for EVs. Tell me a little bit more about where you stand on this idea of interoperability knowing that multiple different models of car can maybe use the same kind of charger?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and it's one of the things that I think that the EVindustry needs to work on a little better. You know, if you go by an internal combustion engine car, it's very straightforward in terms of how you can fuel it right, you know that you're going to find a gas station, you're going to sit there for, you know, a few minutes to fill the tank, and you understand how far you can go. And every car more or less works that way. With electric vehicles, though, it's much more complicated. Not every charger works with every car, not every charger is the same speed. Sometimes there's very big differences between the speeds of chargers, even when they're sort of publicly available. And so the industry right now is really trying to straighten that out. But the complexity there is ultimately going to become something that EV drivers will appreciate, because it gives you more options in how you can fuel your car. And so we are trying to watch the industry try to make these sort of distinctions and charging a little bit smoother. But right now what we have are, you know, in the same way that in the early days of cell phones, you had different kinds of chargers that you had to use to power the battery. I mean, I think that's still the case. Some days, like sometimes a new iPhone version will have a new charging port that you didn't have before. We're kind of in those early days with EVs. And so really, there's there's two standards in the US right now, there's the one that Tesla uses. And there's the one that everyone else uses. And that makes it even more confusing is that you can get an adapter, right. So if you're a Tesla driver, actually, you can get an adapter and use any charger that you know the chargers that the other cars use. But if you're a Hyundai driver, or if you're a GM owner, you can't use a Tesla charger. So it that kind of thing needs to be sorted out and thought through. There is some hope on the horizon, though, there was really big news in the EVindustry last week, because Ford announced that they're going to start adding Tesla's charger to their vehicles. So in a few years, Tesla, and Ford will be able to park in charge at the same chargers. And so now we're waiting to see Oh, is that going to sort of happen with other vehicle makers as well? Is, is Tesla going to open up their network? And for EV drivers, you know, we would hope that that happens, because actually, Tesla has an amazing network all across the country, they put a big investment in developing their EV charging network. And for other drivers, that network isn't quite there yet. The reliability and the number of charges that are out there aren't quite where Tesla drivers have so you know, between what's happening in those other companies and between what's happening in Tesla, we think we can get there. But the industry is still kind of like I said working out which standard to use, who is allowed to use what chargers? And in terms of that standardization is the does the onus really fall on the automakers themselves, Tesla would have to say we're opening up our network or Ford or GM or Hyundai or insert carmaker here, it's on them to decide we're going to tie in with, you know, insert some other carmaker and use the same infrastructure. Yeah, you can imagine it's it's, it's an engineering decision, right? Like do we have to change the the charger type that we've already invested money into. And you also have to imagine that they're thinking, Well, I'm going to be giving more business in a way to Tesla, because now my drivers can are basically paying Tesla for evey charging. And so there's a little bit of a competitive consideration that they have to consider as well. So strategically, they have to decide you know, what's more important and you know, reassuring our drivers that they have more places to charge, or making are trying to create our own category around charging. For us as for at itselectric, you know, we have a couple of things that we think about with these different standards. One thing is our charging hardware is based on a European model where the cord actually is not attached to the charger. And that's one of the ways that we keep that the design of our charging hardware down to a minimum. So drivers carry their own charging cord around with them. And when they charge, they take the cord out and they plug it in. And when they're done, the cord goes in the trunk, and all you're left with on the sidewalk is a nice clean piece of hardware. It protects the cord from the elements and from vandalism. And also for us if there is any damage to the cord, we can very easily replace the cord and we don't have to roll a truck out and have the charger serviced. So operationally it keeps our charges up longer. And the other advantage that we have with the detachable cord model is that we can give a cord to a Tesla driver or we can give a cord to anyone else that has the same standard and doesn't need an adapter. So that's one of the things that we think about in the in this changing industry landscape making sure that drivers will have these options.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eWhether no matter what kind of vehicle they drive, all right, yeah, certainly makes a lot of sense. Now, I want to talk for a second here about a pilot program, I believe you recently announced with Hyundai, tell me a little bit more about this, this partnership, what's what's going on? How's it going to work? What's it going to look like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we, we launched this pilot in April. You know, we're a startup, we've only been around for about a year and a half. And in that time, one of the things that we really worked hard on doing was developing this relationship with Hyundai. And Hyundai, I think saw an opportunity to work with us. Because what we're going to do is, by putting a charger, in a city, where people don't currently have access to charging, you're unlocking a new market to these drivers. And Hyundai makes cars that work really well in cities. In fact, that's the kind of car we drive. So you can imagine that, you know, if we can get these 40 million Americans access to charging, you know, that's a whole new market that that's now opened up to the Evie manufacturers. And what Hyundai did was basically work with us to help us fund the installation of six chargers here in Brooklyn. A couple of them are sorry, a few of them are here in the Brooklyn Navy Yard where we have our headquarters. And a few of them are at a place called the Brooklyn army terminal, which is in Sunset Park Brooklyn. And what we've been doing is sort of a closed pilot, we kind of closed pilot, we invite drivers in, they come in and they use our chargers, they give us feedback on how our hardware is working. And if they have any issues with the detachable cord model. And in that way, we're able to sort of test out this sort of unique kind of model that we're doing. It also allowed us to do the installation, see how much it costs, see if there's any, in any issues that crop up around, you know, once you actually start doing something out in the field, you know, issues come up that you have to address that you couldn't have predicted. So that really, that relationship has been very helpful for us, not only because they helped us subsidize the installation costs, but also because we learned a lot of lessons along the way along the way that will help us as we begin to scale up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly makes a lot of sense. And I imagine that those lessons will become more and more valuable, the more scale you acquire. And with that in mind, I want to take an eye to the future here and think about what comes next for itselectric. Tell me a little bit more about what you specifically are expecting from the future for your business, but also more broadly for EVs generally speaking. What do you see as some of the big themes that are cropping up that you're identifying as things to watch?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's, that is a great question. And, you know, as I said before, like, the industry is changing on a weekly or monthly basis. And one of the things that's been true since we started kind of thinking about its electric a couple of years ago, is that the market demand for EVs keeps exceeding expectations. EVs are very popular. People that get them love them and never want to have a gas car again, regular regulations have come. In the last few years regulations have gone into effect in California and New York state that's basically phasing out the sale of new internal combustion engines by 2035. And the the at the federal level, legislation has come across that is really targeted to incentivize the deployment of EV, charging infrastructure, and offset some of the costs that new EV drivers might have, especially in the early days. And so what we what we expect to happen is kind of what we see happening in Norway, where 90% of new vehicles are electric. In the Netherlands, 40% of new vehicles today are electric, and our niche of the market these 40 million drivers that we have identified, they're going to need 4 million chargers to be installed at least to support their driving behavior. Right. So that is the market opportunity that we are pursuing these millions of curbside chargers that we know need to be deployed in order to enable this transition that consumers are interested in participating in because they want EVs and cities and states are interested in pursuing because it's going to help them meet their climate and sustainability goals. And we think we can be a very significant part of that, because we've developed a model that really lets us get out to scale very quickly, you know, again, by this community and design-centered approach.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. All right. Well, Nathan, this has been wonderful. I really appreciate your time and your insight and telling me a little bit more about itselectric and what you're working on. And the EV space, broadly speaking, has certainly been a wonderful experience. And it's been great to hear a little bit more about your story. So thank you so much for joining me today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, thank you, Kinsey. It's been great. I really enjoyed our conversation. Thank you so much for the opportunity to help us spread the word. We're really looking to get\u0026nbsp;as much attention to this issue around charging in cities as we can so thank you so much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely thank you everybody for listening that was itselectric CEO Nathan King.

I'm your host, Kinsey Grant and I am so excited to be here with you today. This episode is going to be super informative. We have a stellar guest here to talk about online gambling and sports betting and earnings headed right your way right now, Charles Gillespie is Chief Executive Officer, Co-founder and a Director at Gambling.com Group. That's the ticker G-A-M-B. Gambling.com Group is a leading provider of digital marketing services for the global online gambling industry and was founded in 2006. Charles. Welcome to Public, how's it going?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharles Gillespie: \u003c/strong\u003eThings are going very well. Thanks for having me on, look forward to sharing our great story with your audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm excited to hear this story and I think that framing it as a story is really the way to start here. So let's hear a little bit about the beginning of the story. If you will, I want to hear more about your company. Do you mind giving me just a brief overview of your business model?Tell me a little bit about how your business works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure, no problem. So, what we do for the online gambling industry is basically the same thing that, say Hotels.com does for hotels. So if you wanna go to Paris, you're not gonna go to 10 different Parisian hotel websites to find a hotel or you're gonna go to hotels dot com or booking dot com or something like that and get all the information in one place and make a decision there. So, we basically do the same thing for the online gambling industry. So if you're gonna bet on sports and you're in, let's say Massachusetts, (just because Massachusetts just launched sports betting) there are a great many different places you could play at, online in Massachusetts, which are now legal and regulated. And, it, you know, our typical users that go to Google, they search for something like top Massachusetts sports books, they'll find one or more of our websites: we've got betmassachusetts.com, we've also got gambling.com, bookies.com and a lot of other sites, they'll find one of our sites, they'll find the information they're looking for. So, you know, top 10 sports books in, in Massachusetts and then they'll click and leave one of our websites, go to one of those sports books, register deposit play. And then we get paid, and, and what we do is called performance marketing because we only get paid when the traffic we send to these, online gambling companies performs when they actually sign up deposit in play. And if they don't, we don't get paid anything. And that's the the nature of the performance marketing model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo tell me a little bit about, you know, the, the bigger picture that's going on here and we'll get into earnings in a second. But I imagine it's been quite a, a transformative time and, you know, momentous several years for, for your business and for working in the space in which you work with the advent of, of legal gambling and legal, online gambling and sports betting in all, all sorts of different states. Tell me a little bit more about how you view that momentum's impact on your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it really has been a, a hell of a couple of years, but we started this all the way back in 2006. Myself and, and the COO we both went to UNC, we're both from North Carolina. And, we wanted to start a legal and proper business in the online gambling industry, even all the way back in 2006. And back then, there was no legal online gambling in the United States. So we left, and we ended up building this business in Europe. Our largest office has been in Ireland for a number of years. Our largest market has been the UK, for most of the history of the company. And, then in 2018, when the Supreme Court unblocked sports betting, across the US, we had to turn the ship around and point it back at the US and, and really kind of come full circle. So, we've seen this industry grow and grow and grow and we understand how early it still is in the US and kind of North American regulated online gambling market. You know, a lot of people look at New Jersey, which has had, online casino gaming for nearly 10 years. And sports betting for, you know, five years and they think that it's, it's done or it's mature or that, you know, everyone's already signed up for all the, all the online sports books already and there's kind of, you know, it's not gonna grow and, and we know that that's not the case. You know, we've seen big markets like the UK Ireland, even Sweden, Italy, you know, just grow and grow and grow, you know, 20 years after, they first regulated. So we see an incredible situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYou've got this, this industry which is high margin, high growth and booming all around the world, which basically did not exist in the United States for regulatory reasons. And then the doors have just been kind of flung open in 2018. And now you've got a majority of states with regulated sports betting. You got a handful of states with online casino and more are gonna come every single year. so you, you've taken, you're going from this situation where regulated online gambling in the United States was sub a billion. And, I don't even know what the latest figures are because it changes so quickly. But, you know, it's, I don't know, it's, you know, estimates are 40 or 50 billion in, in, you know, another five or 10 years, which is crazy. I mean, it, you can, it's impossible to think of another, industry where you've gone from sub a billion to 50 billion in the space of, you know, 10 or 15 years. So it, it really is an incredibly exciting industry. We do love this industry and, we're very happy to, to be bringing this business back to the United States. And of course, we did the IP O in 2021 which was, you know, we got the picture on the, on the wall behind me here. That's, that was clearly one of the big, one of the big days in our history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I, I can imagine there is a, a ton of excitement and it seems to be a theme, you know, with all this momentum in mind, I want to talk about earnings. You reported earnings late last week, tell me what are three things you would want investors to take away from your most recent earnings report.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eKind of three big lessons. So uniquely within the online gambling industry or at least within the publicly traded companies in the United States that focus on this sector. You know, basically, all of them are high growth but, but very few of them are profitable and very few of them are very profitable and we are both high growth and highly profitable. So, year-on-year growth in the quarter was 36%. Virtually all of that was organic growth. There was a tiny contribution from one month of an acquisition. But, you know, then we also had adjusted margin at 40% and free cash flow of over six million, you know, so we actually make money, you know, in, in, in kind of sharp contrast to a number of the more high profile names in the sector. Which obviously gets a lot of attention. And, and because of that, I think it's, it's, really a unique business. But, the thing I'd, I'd also call out is, look, we grew 33% year on year in North America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd that's against Q one last year, which had the monumental launch of sports betting in New York State, which, you know, I'm sure there's more than a few people listening to this from New York you know, the finance community there is, is great and very into sports betting and it was kind of all the rage in, in Q one last year and, and obviously that drove great results for us a year ago. And despite that kind of blowout number, those blowout numbers in North America a year ago, we still grew 33% year on year in North America, this Q one. But on the other side of the Atlantic and our other kind of main segment in the UK and Ireland, we actually grew 36% year on year, which is even faster than North America, which, again gets back to this idea that this industry keeps growing for a very long time, you know, they regulated online gambling in, in the UK in about 2005. And it, you know, and it, the industry is still growing the affiliates, you know, companies like us performance marketing companies, they're continuing to occupy a kind of bigger and bigger part of the player acquisition within the whole sector. And companies like ours are continuing to take market share within the affiliate performance marketing space. So, you know, to me it's, it's, it's really surprising that we grew even faster in the UK and Ireland, than North America. But, you know, they're both high growth and, and that's perfectly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think that this, this hint at this larger idea that, you know, you, you started this conversation with the story of your company, the story of this industry. I'm curious about whether this last quarter one that you, you know, just reported earnings for, does this impact the bigger picture story for your company at all? Does this change anything for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eI think Q one was, it was like it was a record quarter. But, you know, as a high-growth company, most quarters are supposed to be record quarters. So I think, you know, there wasn't any strategy shift or any sort of, I, I think, I think what was a remark about the quarter was just, it's, the fantastic numbers with us just focusing on the business. You know, there was no acquisitions, there was no, nothing out unexpected, nothing out of the ordinary and, and, and we still drove as strong of a performance as we did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, totally. So, with all of that in mind, I wanna understand a little bit more about the future and hear your perspective on the future. So we'll take a second here to kind of pivot to look ahead. Tell me a little bit about the rest of this year. What are your priorities look like as a company through the rest of 2023?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eGenerally speaking in North America, we focus on, a couple of things. So new state launches are very important for us and we had a number of new state launches last year. This year, they're, we're not expecting to have any new states launch before the end of the year. And that's, you know, that's a very helpful tailwind. But despite that, you know, we've put out very, healthy guidance at the beginning of the year and we've already raised that guidance on the back of the Q one report that we had put out, last week. So, you know, even without new state launches, we're targeting revenue of, 90 where let me make sure I give you the exact, the right numbers here, the, the, the 95 to 99 million, you know, so, knocking on the door of 100 million this year.  And, if we do get any new state launches, you know, because Kentucky is regulated, you know, North Carolina, is probably going to regulate, you know, do the legislation in the next kind of 23 weeks. We're very positive on North Carolina, it's an important state for us. And when those states after they legislate, then they actually need to publish a timeline to launch. And once we have clarity on that, we will add it to the guidance because there's nothing in the guidance now about new state launches. So when we know North Carolina is going live, when we know Kentucky is going live, then we'll, we'll be able to, to tell the market and, and adjust. But the other thing I really, have people think about, and what we are really focused on for the remainder of this year is our new media partnership with Gannet. So Gannet is the largest publisher of daily newspapers in the United States. They publish USA Today, you know, which is the only kind of truly non-business national newspaper in the United States, with a very good sports section. And we have partnered with Gannet to help them monetize sports betting. They know that they've got a huge opportunity with all these different digital media properties of theirs and this great big audience and they came to us to help them, maximize the opportunity and, and, and basically make money off of this industry. If you look at it from our perspective, you know, when we try to grow the business, we can, we can add content to the websites. We already have, we can build new websites, we can buy websites or we can partner with websites and, and that's what we've done with t so, now if you go to USA Today.com/betting, you'll see our content. So that's all us. We've built, you know, essentially this kind of mini site of sports betting information and, and we, you know, pipe that into USAtoday.com and that should be a pretty meaningful driver of revenue, into the end of the year, especially after the start of NFL. So, as you can imagine, the start of the NFL season is really the kind of coming out party, for, for sports betting, every year. You know, it's a, it's a time of the year when, people set up a lot of new accounts, people obviously bet on the NFL more than they bet on anything else. And, you know, being in position at the beginning of the autumn sports season is very important for all sports betting companies, including ourselves. So, we expect to be in a good place in September for that autumn season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, very interesting. And we'll, we'll have to check back in, in September too and I've got one last question for you here, Charles; you've talked a bit here about, you know, the, the bigger story, the broader industry trends and contours that are, are driving gambling as an industry right now, sports betting as an industry right now, I'm curious to hear your perspective on when, if at all, there is a tipping point, you know, you mentioned that the growth you're, you're seeing in Europe, in the UK and Ireland is still significant and still in some ways surprisingly significant, right? But I'm curious about if, you know, there's a point at which that growth might begin to slow down for the industry writ large. Tell me a little bit more about what that might look like if you think that might even come to fruition at all. What do you think the longer-term picture for the industry looks like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I think, I think the growth, you know, by definition has to slow, but, you know, the question is really by how much, you know, and, and you know, how, how many years do we have left while it's still high growth? I.e.; more than kind of 30 plus percent a year. And I would think we've got probably, you know, at least a decade plus, possibly more. You know, not every state has regulated sports betting. Very few states have regulated online casino. And frankly, you know, it's just like a land-based, casino. You know, if you look at the size of the slots and you look at the size of the sports book, there'll be about, you know, 10 times as much space given to the slots. And that's because that's where the money is at. Sports betting is actually kind of a low-margin business. And, and in many, you know, a lot of people in the industry look at it as kind of, a player acquisition tool. It's a way to get someone through the door and then hopefully they stop and play some blackjack or, you know, some slots, which is a, a product in the casino which is a higher margin product. So I think, you know, you've got an enormous amount of regulatory progress left to be made, which, which I think will be made. online casino is a little bit of a tougher sell for some of these legislatures as you can imagine, but it wasn't so long ago that sports betting was inconceivable in, in so many of these states. So, you know, the, there's a kind of 50 plus 60 70 years plus, timeline of, increasingly regulating gambling in the United States and, and online is just kind of the latest, manifestation of that. So, we don't think there's any lack of, of momentum in, in the regulatory, from the regulatory standpoint. And as we, you know, get through the next couple of years, you'll get a couple of online casino states a couple more. And that will really seriously move the needle in addition to some more sports betting states, but even the existing states will grow. You know, there's, there's this kind of surge of interest when the state launches because you have all this pent-up demand which comes to market, and then things settle down. and, but once they settle down, then they grow consistently, you know, for, for, you know, probably 10 plus years. And that gives, you know, you look at the New Jersey numbers, they've had, you know, they've been doing this kind of longer than anyone and the numbers are, are fantastic and still growing. So, you know, it's, it's, and, and to very briefly touch on, you know, all things not North America, you know, this is a global industry, there's a lot of money being made around the world in this industry and it's not just English speaking markets, like, you know, the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, you know, you've got Japan, which is probably gonna come online in the next, you know, a couple of years in a, in a legal way. You've got Brazil, which is regulating, you know, there's, there's a lot of, you know, practically every market in Europe is, is still growing, and, and, you know, profitable and, and, and very nice business for the online gambling operators. You know, our clients, as well as the online gambling affiliates, you know, performance marketing companies like ourselves. So, you know, everybody seems to focus on the US because, you know, we're listed in the US. Our investors are mainly in the US. Of course, it's kind of front of mind for them. But the amount of opportunity outside the US is, is easily as compelling as, as the US opportunity itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, certainly very interesting to keep in mind and I appreciate the big picture thinking and the broad context here, Charles, this has been such a, a wonderful conversation.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI really appreciate you taking the time sharing more about the story of your company and your recent earnings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, it's been wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo thank you so much for coming by.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eMy pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course and wanna once again, want to thank our guest Charles Gillespie, Chief Executive Officer, Co-founder, and a Director at Gambling.com Group.

I am your host Kinsey Grant. I'm so excited to bring you today's show, which is all about space and space technology. We have a great conversation lined up and I'm super excited to jump right into it. Before we do, a quick note: today's show is brought to you by Sidus Space. They provide space-as-a-service products for the space economy. Welcome to today's guest, Jamie Adams, Chief Technology Officer at Sidus Space. Jamie, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks very much, Kinsey. Great to be here and look forward to our conversation today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eI think a lot of the people who are listening to this conversation probably have had space on the brain for a couple of reasons. Recently, a failed launch from SpaceX was in the headines and since then it seems like the space industry has really re-entered the conversation as investors. Jamie, I want to start with a specific question. As we mentioned at the top here, you offer space-as-a-service as a company. Tell me a little bit more about what that means?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eSpace-as-a-service in relation to the work that we're doing at Sidus Space includes building satellites as well as, providing the satellite data, imagery, and a lot more. Our goal is to reduce the cost timeline and operational barriers to space access, making it easier for these projects to be more affordable for organizations, individuals and government agencies to access space. We also make space data [captured via satellite technology] more affordable. We do it through an end-to-end solution. We've got a unique ability to support the full spectrum of satellite development and operations throughout. We also provide space-based aid for numerous industries, including maritime industry, agriculture, mining, forestry, oil and gas production. You name it, there are applications for Earth observation data. Our focus is on providing valuable data and services that serve those diverse sectors. We design our satellites in-house. So that makes us flexible with respect to being able to accommodate customers and needs of users as they emerge, and then also evolve it as the technology evolves. We can incorporate those new sensors and new technologies more rapidly instead of having a stagnant profile of satellites that are working.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYou mention the goal, or at least part of the goal for Sidus Space is to reduce costs, reduce operational barriers and cost. When it comes to an industry like space, it's an expensive business to be in, so there are a ton of operational barriers there. I'm curious about how this idea of standardization might come into play in your effort to reduce the costs and operational barriers for space or space-based companies. Tell me a little bit about standardization as it factors into your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's a great question. There's really no standard operating system or standard approach to developing satellites. So, we're not required to follow particular standards. But we do and have adopted the NASA standards to apply to our satellite development, and what that does for us, working with NASA and DOD, is it allows us to adopt some of the best practices that come out of what there have developed over the course of many years of experience. For example, we use the NASA corps flight software on our satellite, and one of the things that it does is it creates an open interface and open-source solution to consumers who can more readily adopt. It is a little bit easier to adopt and incorporate into the overall architecture so that when consumers come to the table, they have something that they can readily adapt to. We also apply the standards that we have with respect to our ITU filings and the overall adoption of best practices that facilitate working with industry and using terminology that they readily understand. The other thing is for us as a company is that we've been in the business of manufacturing space components for every large program all the way back to the space shuttle. So we've been in the industry for quite a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eI'm curious about how the technology or the services that you're providing might differ based on whether the client or the partner is a government entity, a private company, or an international one. How does that impact the services and the technology that you provide? Yeah, so that's a great question. So one of the things that we do that is,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are various applications that we comply with. So the NASA standards, the S9100, all those things, the adoption of those things, puts us in a very good position to be able to be adaptable, but on the other side, we can customize to user solutions. So, we don't have to offer that to commercial customers that want a little bit more flexibility with respect to getting their hardware into space. The other end of that spectrum is when you are trying to work with government customers, whether it's the U.S. government or international governments, having that understanding and developing that capability to comply with those already. We've been able to adopt both industry standard and government standards with varying degrees of flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eA lot of what we've talked about so far in this conversation has dealt largely with the big picture, these kinds of broader industry contours. I would love to talk a little more specifically about satellites and about satellite tech. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're most excited about in terms of the satellites and the satellite tech that you guys are developing?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eWe are primarily building Earth observation satellites. So there's a couple of different kinds of satellites, communications, Earth observations, there's applications across the, across the board. In the Earth observation spectrum, there's also a ton of components within that, for example, you can do maritime vessel tracking. So, you put an Autonomous Information System, which is essentially collecting beacon data from transmitters on all maritime vessels. And you pull that data up to the satellite and give a very broad range of coverage that the end consumer wants to tie into. You can couple that with imagery sensors and infuse that data together. In some cases there, there's a market for collecting that shipping data, the vessel data where it is, and then providing that to an end consumer. In other cases, if you couple that with imagery, you create another layer of data that is tremendously valuable to the end consumer. So, there's a somewhat limitless amount of market available for the Earth observation satellites. And that's where we're focused: using that data, and those processing systems for the imagery to get near real-time space data and get that to our customers. It's about actionable intelligence for their end use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eI think this brings to mind an important part of the space conversation. When we talk more specifically about technology and its applications, what are the timelines, like for new projects, as as they come about? Is there a way to predict when the technology might actually be utilized or put into use?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eIt can be a little bit unpredictable. There's a lot of things that are out of our control, and we try to do as much as we can for things outside of our control, like the supply chain. That's a big one. One of the things that we do to make our satellites more flexible and keep the cost down is reuse of commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions. It's a big component of what we do. We essentially scour the globe for suppliers to support those efforts. And so that supply chain then is always a factor in the logistics for getting launches in place, whether the weather is going to play a factor, other factors governmentally and things that are going on in the globe, those are all things that can drive our schedules in and in our timelines. We are very focused on making sure that we have a robust level of suppliers, not only have options and backups, but also have great relationships that we've developed with those suppliers to make sure that we can meet our customer timelines. One of our key discriminators for us is trying to accelerate those timelines, with very little notice. We typically say we can get you into space within 12 months, from the time that we get on contract to the time that we actually fly. And we get our payloads in hand and in roughly in the six-month timeframe. But we've got some flexibility within that based on the way we have worked our timelines and our suppliers. It's an ongoing thing that you have to do constantly, revisit that, look for other suppliers. And then the other piece of it is how do we infuse new technologies and putting those on our tech roadmap to bring them in so that we're always kind of tip of the spear with respect to what's out there and what's available to bring into, into our architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eJamie, I'm curious about how you measure the success of a mission. And you know, we asked this, obviously, in the weeks following this starship explosion, that still has been determined to be successful, to some degree. You learn a lesson when something explodes, especially when we're talking about some of the most powerful rockets ever created. But I'm curious about how you as scientists might measure success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eFrom our perspective, trying to measure success can vary from mission to mission. In some cases, if we get to orbit, we're able to establish baseline communications and get core systems up and running. Especially for our initial missions, that is a measure of success. And you mentioned SpaceX and it's an interesting paradigm, because Elon Musk came out and talked about what they thought they could do in that mission, and what they were expecting, and calibrating expectations. So that's another component of it is to calibrate, and set the expectations so that people understand the degree of success, because sometimes, especially based on the fact that we are a space-as-a-service company, sometimes what we're trying to put in space, and and operate for a customer is very unique, and very specific to that particular mission. The degree of success may come within a few weeks, it may come within a few months, or it may take a few years. There are variables. From one to another, we are focused on defining our success criteria. What's the minimum viable product that we come down with, with respect to results? Currently we're focused on Leo, we're looking at, you know, beyond that, but when you're looking at each one of those things into that equation, there are varying degrees of success with respect to the stepping stones to achieve one of those objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eTo close out here and finish up this conversation. Jamie, I would love to talk a little bit about some of the broader industry trends that the people who are listening to this might be most interested in understanding a little bit better. So for anybody who might be interested in the business of space, what would you say are some of the big picture industry trends that you're tracking most right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eAI, compute at the edge, fusion of data, so the quicker that we can incorporate artificial intelligence on the satellite, and take the Earth observation imagery, fuse that together, make the data usable as it is passed down from the satellite so that almost instant gratification perspective of I'm a consumer of the data, how quickly am I going to have my data in hand? How can I use that to drive my market? That's a key component. So anything that you can do to enhance that ability. One of the things that Sidus Space has done is we've employed a significant and diverse portfolio of ground station providers so that the latency of the data coming down to the ground is relatively short. And then when you combine that with compute at the edge, things that we're doing on orbit and bringing that data down. Sometimes customers just want the raw data, but they want it very quickly. So in that case, having the robust support of ground stations where we're going to pass those in a very rapid manner that gets the raw data down to fuse data, data at the edge, AI, you know, those those kind of things that we're going to continue to evolve and put intelligence to that data so that the end user can make quicker decisions about what they're going to apply it to. Those are the keys for keeping ahead of this market, and making sure that our customers are getting what they're looking for. And that could also be the same thing with payloads that we're flying. Their ability to exercise their payload, have it operate in space, and immediately take that data and take it out to their customer base or their development timelines. Because a lot of these people, it's a race to get their technology developed, get it proven in space against their competitors. We have an ability to help them accelerate that pace of where they're actually going to be able to fly their technology and get their data down to the ground in a usable manner where they can make key performance decisions. And that globally applies to any of our customers on the back end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you, Jamie. I think this is a fantastic way to finish out this conversation with some of these forward looking ideas. And I really appreciate your time. It's been so wonderful to hear more about your perspective and to hear more about scientists. So thank you so much, Jamie.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eKinsey, thank you and appreciate everybody tuning in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eI want to thank Jamie Adams, Chief Technology Officer at Sidus Space for his time today.

I'm excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, me too, me too. Okay, so Rene, I wanna start here with kind of the big picture. We are definitely going to get into the Inflation Reduction Act stuff, which has obviously been a huge moment for renewables as a sector. We'll get to that during this conversation, but before we get there, I would love to talk about solar as it fits into renewables as a broader sector in investing in the economy. Tell me a little bit about how solar is tracking within the renewable sector right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure. So, you know, if it's okay, maybe just take a step back and, you know, just think of renewables or clean energy in the sense of this energy transition that's taking place. And so, you know, I think we all recognize what are the drivers there. So one, you got climate change. You know, the science does demonstrate that the burning of fossil fuel does have a major impact to the air we breathe, right? And so there's the negative impacts associated with the environment. There's negative impacts associated with human health. And then there's the economic impacts that are also a result of some of this climate change. So I think of clean energy, renewable sort of along the sustainability sort of opportunity set, if you will. I think secondly, there's energy security we need to think about. So, you know, the less reliance we have on energy imports, you know, think of the power OPEC has and how that impacts the average consumer, you know, I think renewables can help solve for that. And then there's economic benefits. I mean, if we think about job creation as a result of some of these new transitions that are taking place, the new technology, if you will, and then also the lower energy costs as we create more scale along some of the renewable sources. So it really is exciting what's taking place, renewables. If I look at solar specifically, you know, it's just one important part of the sort of renewable puzzle. And so I think of solar in the context of what are the other renewable energy sources. So, generally speaking, you think about wind, you think about hydro, you think about biomass, and geothermal, and collectively renewables are surpassing US electric generation. For example, we passed nuclear in 2021, we passed coal-fired generation in 2022. So renewables are really having a meaningful impact. The US renewables represent 21, 22% of US electricity generation. Solar is about 3.5% of that, which goes to the question. So solar, as a part of this renewable puzzle, if you will, it is a, it's unique and it's very important. It's widely available, easy to deploy. So we think about the sun as a resource. Clearly, it's a resource that we have available day in and day out. It could be easily installed, so it's flexible. So think about installing rooftops, large solar farms, as an example. I think what's unique about solar, from an investment perspective, is cost. And so if we think about from 2010 to about 2020, we've seen costs of solar installs come down. Now, it hasn't been just a straight line downward. We've seen some pressures and increase in costs the last couple of years. But that in itself, if you think about some of the trade-offs, we go back to early 2000s, a lot of consumers, for example, were not doing the math and saying, hey, what is the breakeven if I want to install a solar panel in my home? And generally, it was about 20 years. And then you fast forward to today, and that breakeven. In a single digit of years. And again, there's a lot of other factors that can go into that. But clearly there's been a lot of advancements. So I think that makes soil unique. The economic benefits and job creation, which I mentioned earlier, if we think about solar jobs in comparison to oil extraction, coal mining, there's actually more US jobs in solar production than there are in those two categories, which I don't think many people realize. So there is this economic benefit. And sort of the last component I think about solar, and I know this is a long answer, so I apologize, but the innovation, the technology around solar. If I think of the solar plus storage, for example, Renova, which is one of the holdings in one of our ETFs, partners with Tesla's Powerwall for installs. The solar battery storage went from saving approximately six minutes worth of energy up to about 10 hours plus today. And so those are some of the factors that I think make solar exciting if I think about renewable energy more broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a phenomenal way to get started with this conversation. I think that established a ton of the important context that we need to understand why solar and renewables, more broadly speaking, have become a theme that investors might be gravitating toward. And later in the conversation, I do want to make sure we hit on that element of how investors might be able to add solar as a theme to their investing portfolio and to their investing strategy. But even before we get there. I would love to dig in a little bit more to the nitty gritty of the renewable sector, particularly solar. When we're talking about the energy value chain, the solar energy value chain, I'm curious about what has made it such that those prices have come down. We're talking obviously about a lot of different moving parts and elements that come together to create solar as a part of the renewable sector. But I'm curious to hear a little bit more about the industries or the sub-industries that might be contributing to this wider proliferation of solar energy as part of the renewables landscape. What are those elements that are coming together to make solar a more affordable or more accessible option right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so I think in the general sense, or in these terms, is increased utilization, increased technology. And that scalability has helped bring down costs if I think of the solar value chain Specifically, so you know generally the components are you have sort of the production side insulation side you have financing then you have kind of ongoing maintenance and When you think of it from you know, just breaking down some of these segments. So the first component is upstream, so think polysilicon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, DocuNew Energy and GCL Technologies, who are the largest players in this space, those polysilicon costs have come down quite a bit. And these materials are used for kind of that midstream area where we think about solar panel manufacturers. So, you know, solar panels are made up of PV cells. They convert sunlight into electricity. So you have solar wafers, solar cells, and solar modules. The companies that played this there would be like Cinco Solar Canadian solar United renewables These are sort of your midstream players. This also includes inverter Manufacture so you have to at some point convert your son into your DC to AC back to DC and so these inverters are Inverse using manufacturers. So think of like the end phases of the world solar edge. These would be considered kind of that midstream category. And then from there, you kind of go downstream. So now start thinking about installers, distributors, some of the utility companies. And Cavus is a big solar utility company. No far energy, if I think about like installations and building out of some of these solar farms, they're a big company in this space. So globally, this sets up sort of this value chain. And so as more commitments to increasing solar utilization, increasing capacity, that has over time driven down cost. When we look at sort of the space and say, well, who are some of the bigger suppliers that are helping, you know, reduce some of these costs? You know, China is the biggest manufacturer when it comes to solar manufacturing, solar parts. And so it's really some of their scale. We looked at China economically a lot for lower manufacturing costs. But collectively, that has brought down some of the costs. And so demand is growing not only in China, it's growing in Europe, it's growing in the US. So all these countries and corporations, for that matter, who are making commitments to reduce their carbon emissions, is all contributing to the scale and that's ultimately bringing down some of those costs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, it certainly makes a lot of sense. And I think this idea of the way that renewables are scaling and solar specifically are scaling right now certainly makes a compelling case for why this cost might be decreasing. This utilization has really picked up and we have reason to believe that it might continue to pick up because of news that has come from DC, from certain industry, but very much DC over the last year or so. I think this is a great segue to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed last year, made some pretty landmark provisions for clean energy. I would love to hear your perspective on how the Inflation Reduction Act, commonly referred to as the IRA, how that might've impacted solar. Tell me a little bit more about what the impact has been from that legislation on the solar space. So, I'm gonna go ahead and start with the solar. So, I'm gonna start with the solar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it was huge, in my opinion. You know, I think it just speaks to our commitment, which globally, I think there was some concern. So, you know, not to get into the politics of it, but, you know, it's kind of goes to the timeline. You know, there was a transition from President Trump to President Biden. You know, almost immediately he rejoins the Paris Accord. And so this is sort of the global commitment to reduce, you know, carbon emissions. And then he also had his legislation that ultimately got passed, the Inflation Reduction Act, and it resulted in the largest climate-related bill ever. So $369 billion in spending and green energy tax credits were a result of the IRA. And so in some cases, it extended some tax credits that are already exist. Some listeners maybe heard of the Energy Policy Act that was created back in 2005. And so there were already some subsidies or tax credits that were in place that were sort of being reduced over time. And so this sort of reignited those tax credits, extended them for another 10 years, increased some of those tax credits up to 30%. And so this really helps stimulate this marketplace. And so if I think some of the impact of the IRA specifically, you heard me talk a lot about reducing carbon emissions. So I think this sort of fast tracks the US a little bit. There are various studies out there. I think some of what I read was perhaps it increases our speed by 40 percent in terms of hitting some of these targets by 2030. So I think that was impactful. I think also there were parts of the IRA that included tax credits for production. So there's been a lot of talk, I think we've heard in the news, around on-shoring, so reducing our reliance on other countries and their production. So there was a lot of supply chain issues, for example, that delayed and increased costs recently. And so these new incentives should and actually are enticing companies to produce and manufacture here in the US. So again, I talked about some of the economic benefits around job creation. So that's a positive. And we've seen some of the largest manufacturers. So First Solar, A Solar, you know, they've all committed already to manufacture here in the US. So, you know, this should serve as a stimulus really to this transition. Now again, I think we have to acknowledge the environment we're in today. You know, we have a high inflation and interest rate environment. So we are seeing a little bit of maybe not the quick acceleration that we would like. And I think a lot of it is because now you have consumers, businesses have to make decisions around investments due to the inflation and trade environment. But nonetheless, over the long term, this is viewed as net positive. And I think the one thing I'll say too, and I hope, I just want to emphasize that, because the costs have come down so significantly, because corporations and countries are committing to reducing their carbon emissions, I look at some of these subsidies and incentives as really icing on the cake. And so in other words, I think we were kind of going down this path already, and now you have some, let's call it longer commitments in terms of the US with these tax credits that should help maybe move some of those that were on the fence a little bit about making that commitment, sort of bring them over the line, if you will. So I think it's really exciting and we should see increased solar production as well as solar utilization here in the US over the next few years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a great kind of big picture, 30,000 foot view of what's going on in solar. And it's certainly helpful to hear the context in the background around how this very much talked about legislation is actually going to come to fruition with the economic realities that we're all facing today. So now that we have gotten that big picture, that kind of zoom out view of what's going on in solar, I would love to talk a little bit about the more micro, how can investors who are listening to this, include solar in their portfolios as a theme, knowing what we know now about the impacts of the global value chain of the Inflation Reduction Act, of all of these big picture ideas we've talked about. How can investors approach potentially adding solar into their strategy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I guess there's a lot of couple of ways, right? So hopefully you've heard over my comments. I talked about some of the value chain, if you will. So certainly there's ways to sort of handpick companies, if you're an integral stock buyer, to try and pick and choose those that you think could participate in this theme. I think there's some maybe more efficient ways. The ETF market allows you really to capture a theme. We here at Invesco actually have the industry's first and largest solar ETF. The ticker on that is $TAN. And really the approach of this fund, so it's a passive strategy, it's rules-based. We basically are tracking the max solar index. And what this index is comprised of is all the companies that sort of represent the solar value chain. And so what the methodology or the index does is it screens for companies that either will be considered a pure play, so two-thirds or more of their revenue is coming from the solar theme, and those would get sort of like a 1.0-factor weighting, if you will. And then companies that we consider medium plays. These are companies that have at least a third. And up to two-thirds of the revenue coming from the Solar theme. They'll get sort of a half of their weighting. And this then index sort of creates a list of companies. Currently, there are 44. It's a modified market cap. So it'll set limits on how much a company can represent in the portfolio. So the limit today is 10%. And then what happens is every quarter that those rules are reapplied and rebalanced on a quarterly basis. So you're ensuring you're maintaining ownership of these pure plays. I think an interesting thing as well as about this ETF, the solar landscape is global. So I mentioned China is a leader. We're seeing growth in Europe. And so you are going to have global representation in this US, which is important if you really want to capture the theme. So today, it's about 35% US exposure, 15% is coming from China, 12% is real. Then you have some smaller ones. You have some Germany holdings, Hong Kong. So it really gives you sort of that broad exposure to the theme. And it's just a convenient way in one ticker to get exposure. The fund is currently about two billion in size. So I mentioned it's one of the largest and it's got a cool ticker too, I mean, T-A-N, tan, easy to remember, think of the sun. And so it's been an easy way for investors to get pure-play exposure to this theme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly tan during the summertime. How could you forget it? So simple. All right, so Renee, this has been such a wonderful conversation. I really appreciate all of your incredible context and analysis, and insight. Feel like I've really learned a ton about this space right now. That has certainly gotten a lot of interest over the last several months and years. So thank you so much for coming on the public podcast and for sharing all of this with us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eExactly.

I'm your host Annika Lewis. Today we're joined by Pooja Rajan, founder of Etherworld and Ethereum community builder who will help us break down the game changing Ethereum upgrade that just happened, which has sparked a rally for the world's second largest cryptocurrency. Pooja, thank you so much for being here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. I'm so excited to be back here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, very big week. Lots of news to discuss. So plenty to cover today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFirst off, can you tell us a little bit about what just happened? So what was the Shapella upgrade? The combination of the Shanghai and Cappella upgrades – what does it accomplish? And why is it such a big milestone for Ethereum?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, of course. So Shapella, as you have beautifully explained, is a combination of Shanghai and Capella. So Shanghai executed four core EIPs on the main net, whereas Capella brought some specific changes on the consensus layer. So these four EIPs were \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEIP-4895, 3651, 3855, and 3860.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe rest\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e three EIDs, which starts from three, most of them are for EVM upgrades, EVM changes, and there was this 36511 coin base, which was a tool to make gas cheaply, cheaper for contract developers, however, EIP 4895, introduced a system level operation to support validator withdrawals. Withdrawals were the key change for this particular upgrade. So many people may know that Ethereum moved into proof of stake back in 2022 with the merge, but the proof of stake work on the chain started back in 2020 with the release of Beacon chain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe shift towards POS already happened in the past two upgrades. However, it closed the loop with the Shapella upgrade. So in 2020 when it was introduced it was unidirectional; people can only add ETH, become a validator and have their reward in the wallet but that was not realized. Shapella upgrade enabled accessing those rewards and validators can now go in and come out freely. If they want to stay they can come out with partial withdrawals and if they want to completely exit they can come up with the full withdrawal. So that's what the Shapella upgrade brought to the Ethereum Network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Thank you for the overview. And I would love to focus a little bit on withdrawals because they were one of the big headlines of this upgrade from what you just shared. And, of course, there were worries, folks had of initial rapid outflows after the upgrade. But just .3% of all 18.1 million tokens staked were actually withdrawn in the 12 hours after the upgrade based on data from Nansen. And so tell us a little bit about your perspective on withdrawals. Are you surprised at the low withdrawal rate? Why do you think stakers are keeping their Ethereum? What do you take away from all this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are a couple of things about it. I think that can be my perspective, which I would like to share with you. First of all, like, when people were trying to activate withdrawal, there was this validator credential change that has to happen before they can enable their withdrawal. So far, only 72 people validated credential has been updated, right at that time, when withdrawal, when this upgrade happened 40,000 credential changes took place. So that is the first thing, the first blocker for validators to withdraw because they have to first be able to change their credential. A message was signed, and many of the validators have already done it, but some of them are still in process. That's part one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other two parts are that the Ethereum chain has a churn limit like not everybody can withdraw their money at one point of time, at the same time. So they have to go through a process cue, there are certain limits for the partial withdrawal per day. Similarly, there are certain limits for full withdrawal per day, we try to maintain this protocol there. So we do not put the security of network for a concern at any point of time. There should be a good flow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's there for the second thing. And the most important thing, which I think is with this Shapella upgrade, obviously many validators were able to take out their XX the reward that they have earned over a period of time. And this gives confidence to many others who were planning to take out their money, or were planning to get into the system. So I think the Shapella upgrade gives a lot of confidence to existing and new validators to continue doing their duties as a validator on the network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome, appreciate that rundown. Talking a little bit more about just kind of the withdrawal risk and helping people understand the theory and how it works. So, about 16% of all the ether supply has been locked up in the protocol for staking as of earlier this month, you talked earlier about the Ethereum chain having a turn limit and not everyone being able to withdraw at once. So, what would happen in theory, if stakers decided to withdraw a lot in a large portion of that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLarge portion here can be the maximum that they have earned plus the deposit that they have made on the network. I think the average is somewhere around 34 ETH per validator on the network as of now. So, if again, the validator decided to take out all that means they are making full withdrawal at any particular time that they are willing to make that withdrawal and they are signaling about it. With the process of withdrawal there is another process going on in parallel is becoming a validator. If we take a look at the chart like I had data for the month of February, we have a good amount of validators also getting in.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, with that churn limit, we definitely do not see the network in threat at any point because they would not allow too many validators to come out of the chain at any single day. And at the same time, there are validators who are also getting into staking as I mentioned. I am taking a look at the dashboard by Metrica which is supported by Ethereum. So, if we can take a look here, you can see that as validators are coming out, they are also getting in so security is there. The loop is closed, which means the function is working properly. So I think people will be getting confident only instead of losing that and when they decide to come out you know, they also have limited options.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat they can do with the Eth they want to take out either they can trade it to you know, get into some other cryptocurrency or in cash that or they can keep it in their own wallet like E-wallet but there's no point keeping it with them in their wallet and not doing anything with that. There is another option that is coming up is like staking with the help of a liquid staking pool. That's another option. But again, with a liquid staking pool, people will also come as validators into the system. So yeah, I don't see a threat yet. Obviously there, there's a lot of confidence getting in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. And for those on the call, who are perhaps less familiar with Ethereum and ETH staking, can you talk a little bit about what the incentives are for people to keep their Ether staked even now that the Shapella upgrade is complete?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, the minimum requirement is if you want to become a solo staker, of course, the minimum requirement is 30 ETH that you have to deposit on the network. However, if you do not have the study of ETH, there are multiple options available in the ecosystem. You can go with as I mentioned, like the liquid staking pools. So, for becoming a solo staker also, you need to have a set of, you know, technical help also to run both nodes execution node and consensus node on your own like on your on your home or wherever you want to do that and make sure that they are online at all points of the network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, if you are not technically skilled enough to participate in the network as a solo staker, you can definitely take advantage of the staking services provided there are different kinds of staking services liquid staking is quite popular, because that also gives you the advantage of making use of the Eth while you have already staked like there are like they provide a token that pool token that you can be using in place of ETH. So there are other services, I think going with the services is a good way to get involved and make money. But if you want to make a real contribution and want to learn the network more, it would be a good idea to do solo staking. There are 10 clients available, five on the execution side and five on the consensus side. And they all have discord channels, they are willing to provide all kinds of support. So that's always less risky. But yeah, there are multiple options people can use.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGot it. And do you anticipate the unlocking of staked Ether and the rewards that will be paid out is going to attract intensified regulatory pressure from the SEC or how do you think about that and the change that just happened?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp; We are aware Kraken and Coinbase are definitely having some regulatory pressure right over there. But I am not sure if that's because of the unlocking of ETH that could be with their process like the way they would like to operate in the United States. This depends on the government. But I highly doubt that locking unlocking will in any way affect the government policy over here because locking unlocking is an individual's choice and if they are participating in a blockchain that depends on the government of that location where he or she is living, right? So I don't think they’re interrelated. That's what I meant to say here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. All right. So zooming out a little bit, just into kind of Ethereum’s journey more broadly. How does this upgrade position Ethereum for more long term success and mainstream adoption?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So, as I was mentioning, like Ethereum, proof of stake was kind of a dream for Ethereum people who started them back in 2015. They always wanted to have proof of stake. It took time like it took a lot of years to be here. Finally, we are having a full cycle of Ethereum validators here. I think now we have a complete system built up. Now what we need to do is improve the present system. We need to improve the present blockchain and that's what is our next priority.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the next upgrade that we are hoping to have would be based on scaling obviously, the proposal, inactive discussion and maybe ready for dev nets as well is EIP 4844. That will help layer two projects to maybe interact with the chain and be able to scale Ethereum transactions as well. So that's next.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think there could be few other improvements to be done. We would probably propose builder separation to try to make it more decentralized to the set of validators, proposers, relayers so we can make sure that security is never at threat. But if we talk about a system and ecosystem that can be, you know, running in parallel or the present ecosystem, Ethereum blockchain has already provided that with the Shapella upgrade.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. And zooming out a little bit more to kind of more of the mainstream adoption piece, do you believe that Ethereum will eventually surpass Bitcoin as the most dominant cryptocurrency and what do you think is still left? What would it take for that to happen?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSurpassing Bitcoin – that's an interesting question. I would like to share my take on that. So I believe that Bitcoin is the number one currency because of its total market price like shares that it contains, as well as the value that it has, right? But if you look at the user, you would see Etherum\u0026nbsp; has more distributed users. Multiple projects are running on top of Ethereum blockchain. Projects are trying to interact with Ethereum Blockchain. So I'm definitely confident here that Ethereum may, in the long run, be ahead of Bitcoin definitely in terms of user base.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePrice wise, it's hard to predict because a lot of things are associated with it. Ethereum transactions require gas, we are trying to figure it out and gas is again, the ETH there. So a lot of things to be taken care of. I am not in a position to talk about the price. But from users perspective and mainstream adoption. I think it's already ahead in the race.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, awesome. All right. Well, before we wrap up Pooja, anything else you'd like to share or anything else we should be aware of coming up for the Ethereum community?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would say that people need to be here, if we want this to be the most decentralized network. Ethereum has a good user base, but this contributor base can never be enough. We want the mainstream people to join us and for that they have to join and make the contribution in the way they can make. There are multiple opportunities Ethereum protocol gets into a lot of research – there are a lot of research findings going on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you would like to learn more about Ethereum, pick up the topics that people are working on. Join us as an intern. Ethereum also has this EPF - Ethereum Protocol Fellowship program, join those programs if you are a developer, if you are a researcher or a PhD institution, reach out to contribute your research work. There's a lot of opportunity to get involved. Obviously, you can make money by becoming validated and earning rewards as well. And trading is another thing, but you become a part of the network, by your way, the way you like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, look forward to what we are doing here. There's lots of new changes coming up as I was mentioning about 4844. Account abstraction is already out there EIP 4337 so wallet and these types of smart contract developers can start taking a look at this proposal and may implement it in their projects. There are a lot of opportunities out there. Stay tuned. All the best to everyone. I hope Ethereum will become a big success with the help of you all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Thank you Pooja and before we drop, if folks want to follow you, where can they follow you to hear more about what you're talking about with respect to Ethereum? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjam: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs I mentioned, I'm a part of Ethereum Cat Herders. So ETH Cat Herders discord is one of the best places where people can come and chime in and share their questions, comments, concerns related to Ethereum blockchain or Ethereum protocol. I'm also available on Twitter at poojaranjan19, so you can follow me on most of the social media Twitter, Telegram and all so yeah, I'm available there as well.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome - well thank you so much for being here and for talking about this very important upgrade with all of us. I know I learned a lot and I'm sure everybody else did too. Once again, this was Pooja Ranjan and founder of Etherworld and Ethereum community builder. Thanks, everyone.

We're going to be covering lots of things from The possible TikTok ban and its potential impact. With us today, once again is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. He is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 timeless stop picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts and we are doing a book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public live handle. You see it right there on the top of your screen, folks. All right, it's time to get into it. Hi, Mark. Welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, Kori. Good. Hey, good to hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's good to hear you too. A lot of change actually Mark since I last talked to you. I don't know if you're aware a lot in the financial industry has changed. But today we're gonna focus on the tech stuff and what's happening with TikTok, I mean, the company's CEO, he provided that testimony. He was on Capitol Hill this morning, where he really received some tough, tough criticism with one lawmaker even stating, and I quote, I expect today, you'll say anything to avoid this outcome, but we are not buying it. What were your takeaways from the TikTok CEOs testimony?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that none of my children ever have to go on the Capitol Hill and testify with the weekend that he had, I wouldn't wish that fate on my greatest enemy. So I'm sorry to carry on being kind of glib about it. But that was, you know, I respect him. And I respect him for going up there and taking that, it's kind of like Zuckerberg, you know, in the last year or two or two years ago, being brought up to Capitol Hill to testify. It's kind of like the leaders of tech being brought up there Bezos and, and Tim Cook, etc, are being brought up to testify that was just unfortunately for TikTok, they're going up against two major issues, social health concerns, related to social media usage. And then much more importantly, these days is national security issues. And so, you know, you knew that the question was just how much defense he could play in that time, and I didn't watchall of the testimony. But that's what I was just struck by and I think maybe more importantly, just today's testimony, the action question for all of us as public market investors because we can't invest in TikTok or, or at least not as a separate standalone asset. I don't think we'll ever see it that way, is what are the implications of this for other social media assets, specifically, Snap, Meta, and Google? And I think the probability of TikTok getting banned in the US is just increasing, you know, relatively materially over the last 12 months. I know there are a lot of constitutional issues around this. And I think they're very serious. But I just think that the odds of some sort of ban or major restriction have increased materially. And so that's kind of a pending catalyst. And anytime the news flow comes up, you'll see names like Snap and Meta outperform on that day, which is what you're seeing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel what I'm hacking a little bit more in terms of the broader social media context, because you did reference, you know, Zuckerberg having to go up there kind of, you know, defend all the stuff that Facebook, you know, had going on all the negative things specifically, right, that was happening. I mean, you even saw back in the day with Dorsey, he had to go there. Back when he was still leading his company. He co-founded Twitter. I mean, you see it across the board, it doesn't seem to be net like it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon. And one of my takeaways from what happened today with TikTok, specifically, Mark is that I feel like they're also getting the brunt of all of the aforementioned right, big social media companies. It's like they've had enough time at the batting cage, right? With the Facebooks, with the Googles of the world, with the Snaps that now they're just ready to unleash completely on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori, I think that's right. But no, but don't forget this. I mean, we got a major political issue, growing political tensions between the US and China. And that's what made this tougher, I think, than anything that the tech companies had to face before because, you know, they,Those are US companies, you know, presenting in front of their elected representatives. That's not the case with TikTok and at the moment when relations between the US and China are at the lowest that they've been and, you know, I'm no expert on that. But um, in some time and maybe decades, so it's just, there's just a lot of different angles here that made it much tougher for TikTok to come through and again, it's kind of hard to see a political out here because it looks to look from where I stand it, it looks like the US military has banned Tiktok from personnel devices, personal and personnel devices. You've had more states do that. You've had a federal government do that you'd like that. That's from government-owned devices. So you've already gotten pretty far down the path here. You've never had that happen with any of the other apps. So and that's not because there's a greater social health issue related to TikTok than there was to Snap or to Facebook. It's because of the Chinese national security issue. So that this is just a bigger, this is just my this is more explosive of an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e No, it definitely is something else that you brought up earlier is that you know, you don't think there will ever really see TikTok, as a standalone kind of investable company where people like you or myself, your company would be able to then you know, buy shares in TikTok, it is owned by ByteDance. However, are there some scenarios perhaps in your mind Mark that could play out if TikTok were forced to sell or spin on where it could become, you know, a company at some point that you are I could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well I don't think so. There was an article in the papers this morning in China that the Chinese government for the first time made an official statement that they would be strongly opposed to a forced sale of TikTok. So I mean, I'm no expert on China, I just assumed that there would be some statement that would come out along the way to this effect. Well, it's out. So I think that's why a ban is such a distinct probability, because I don't think ByteDance will be allowed, even if they wanted to, and I don't think they want to, they wouldn't be allowed to sell TikTok to a US company. So TikTok's in the middle of a geopolitical Firestorm that's, it's unfortunate for them. And you know, I give them all credit. This is a highly innovative company now, whether they actually create a national security risk, that's, you know, there are thorough, thoughtful arguments on that. But anyway, that probably matters. Neither here nor less, it doesn't matter now, Kori, we're not gonna be able to get the chance to invest. So let's focus on the companies that could be derivatives of there. That's Meta. Alphabet because of YouTube and Snap. And I really do think sometimes we spend a little too much time on Snap as a derivative. I think that the use case you know, for those who have used TikTok a lot, you think about what other assets like Snap is more of a communications tool than that kind of leaned forward entertainment tool. That TikTok is but the analogies are really, Instagram and YouTube and those would be the beneficiaries where they were TikTok to be banned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, that was a foreign mission company is like Google because of YouTube likes Facebook, obviously, also owns Instagram. This is a perfect lead into my next question, because I know over at Evercore, you guys recently hosted a panel with three experts who collectively oversee $1 billion in ad budgets, these are companies that have really been struggling right in the ad space. But the panel revealed some signs that this ad a winter it could be starting to thaw, could you provide some insight into what you're seeing in the ad space, and how we could you know, positively impact some of those other companies that we could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think we're still in an ad winter, I think that's what we've uncovered so far with, with the channel checks that we've done, maybe that's not terribly surprising. And, you know, there's a broadening consensus that, that we do have a recession coming. So you know, we could be staying in an ad winter for quite some time. I don't think we're going to see crocus's anytime soon. I think Kori, those are the first plants that show up in the snow out of the snow, but you're also into horticulture Mark, you're a man of many talents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e And somebody can correct me on my pronunciation of crocus's. But, but, but I, I don't, I don't think we're gonna get a quick V shape recovery in marketing spend in advertising spend. And so that's going to be a bit of a drag on some of these names. The advantage and one of the reasons we like Meta frankly, one of the reasons it's our number one recommendation is you don't need to believe that to be long Meta, because they've taken so many of the costs out of their business. And then they've got this new reals, monetization, and they're doing much better targeting than they were years ago. And if you've got this new ad format called click to messaging, click the message which is used much less than the US but it's widely used outside of the US especially in areas of the world like Latin America and parts of Asia. And that's, that's a it's a brand new there's like a product cycle here. You need a product cycle because the overall market is getting soft, and it's not good. It's not firming up yet it's not getting better. And we're still in an ad winter and you know, we should probably assume we're gonna continue to be one for as it's gonna be a long winter it's gonna be several more months at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark I don't know. I remember you being this type of pessimistic in terms of the ad winter continuing and then you brought up the dreaded R word recession, goodness, a lot of things in what you just said that are very important takeaways. I'm gonna keep it moving, though, because Amazon, this is a company that has been doing a complete like 180 in terms of its firing, it's not doing the speed hiring anymore. They just announced on Monday, they're gonna lay off another 9000 employees. Do you have any thoughts on this mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think the big backdrop here is actually I thought Amazon was the first of the major tech companies to acknowledge that they had over hired overbuilt during the COVID crisis, they said this on their march 22 earnings call that was the that would have been last April, so about a year ago, but then they didn't really act on it. Whereas I think Facebook didn't acknowledge it early, but then they acted on it by laying off a good number of employees. Look, these layoffs are they're no fun for anybody there painful for all people involved. I've gone through it. And, so I wish it on nobody but you know, just as consumer households have to tighten their belts when times get tough. So do corporations, and especially those that over-hired and over-extrapolated from COVID demand trends. And Amazon was one of those, you could actually look they grew their expenses faster than they grew their revenue, and their revenue grew quickly, from 2019 to 2022. So they did overbuilt, they acknowledged it, and they needed to do one or two rounds of cuts, and they've done the two rounds of cuts. As long as we don't go into a steep recession, I don't think they need to do another round of cuts. But doing those cuts was necessary. You also had a bit of a change in but you've had a major change in management over the last two years. It's given a new CEO who's been with the company for 20 years. So he's not new to Amazon by any means. But it gets given them some time to maybe look through all the portfolio of bets, and assets that Amazon hasn't maybe pair some things back maybe not lose $10 billion a year on Alexa, which was a reported number, which was terrifically high. So anyway, I think I think that's kind of what you're getting out of Amazon, which is they're getting deep now into belt-tightening. And I do think that at the end of the day, when we come out of this, and when we get back to more normal economic times, companies are going to be doing this on the lower cost base. And that means you create what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. So when the revenue recovers on a lower cost base, that means that earnings can grow much faster. And that can be a great long equity opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's definitely hope that it will be really quick, Mark, before I get you out of here. I know that you are recently out in Las Vegas for the PROSPER show, which is a gathering of E-commerce sellers and solution providers just really quickly for all the rest of us who were not able to attend the show. What insights did you take away about the Amazon marketplace from that show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's still remarkably a positive experience for most sellers that are on there. And I think you're seeing a lot of them. I guess one of them the most part, the single most interesting takeaway for me was, I think it was 8 out of the 10. Amazon Marketplace, sellers that we spoke to are currently using advertising on Amazon. And Amazon don't tell anybody this but they're generating close to $40 billion a year in advertising revenue, they're going to be the next $100 billion a year ad revenue company. And that's not going to be next year or the year after. But sometime in the next three to five years. They'll be up there. I mean, they're gonna be in spitting distance of Facebook and Google. And because it's a high-intent platform and marketers and advertisers love to be in high-intent platforms. So that was probably the biggest takeaway. Merchants really like advertising on Amazon, watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow. Well, the faculty said they're going to be in spitting distance of those big behemoths like Google and Facebook. That's definitely something to watch. As always, we love when you come on Public lot to share your insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, the senior managing director and head of internet research team over at Evercore ISI.

All right. Let's do it. Folks. Welcome one and all public live. I'm your host this afternoon. JD Durkin. I'm so happy to be here with all of you today learning about the evolving air transportation space and how Blade is bringing innovation to the world of travel. I am thrilled to welcome our special guests for the afternoon. Will Heyburn the CFO of blade welcome to Public Live. Great to have you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Thanks so much for having me very excited to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Of course my man. It's great to have you. So Blade provides of course air transportation alternatives to pretty congested ground routes. And for those of us who live in New York City, we know that that's basically a daily occurrence. And you bring those alternatives to communities all around the world. Will, help break down Blades passenger segment offering and its value add.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so just real quick, you know, Blade is really focused on those use cases for air mobility that can be profitable today. So we're laser-focused on areas where you have that addressable market of customers where we can save them a tremendous amount of time, for a price that's going to be competitive to ground transportation. As a reminder, we're doing this in an asset-light fashion, we don't own or operate any aircraft. And that's what allows us to grow so quickly expand so quickly, and do it in an extremely capital-efficient way. This also allows us to be really nimble between different markets, depending on the macro environment, and be 100% Ready for the future electrification of air mobility, which we think will be coming soon with electric vertical aircraft that are gonna allow you to fly more quietly, which means communities are going to let you land more places, but are also going to let you do that in a more cost-effective manner. So we're focused on doing that and both passenger and medical where we're the largest transporter of human organs in the United States for transplant. But I'll start with your question. On passenger. Like I said, we're laser-focused on places where we can save folks a huge amount of time. And so for us today, that's in Canada, Western Canada, between Vancouver and Victoria, where we're taking what would be a three four-hour journey of car trips, Ferry rides, and we're turning that into a 30-35 minute helicopter flight between Vancouver and Victoria landing right in the middle of the city center for between $200 and $300. We're also in New York City where you already mentioned, we can take your two to three-hour trip between Manhattan and JFK make that a five-minute flight that starts at $195. If you're trying to get an Uber in New York, you know, it can often be more expensive than that. And then we're in southern France flying between Nice and Monaco, for about $200. That's a seven-minute flight. And also between Nice and Saint Tropez. And in the winter we fly between Geneva of course Courchevel and other ski destinations. These are the places in the world where for not a lot of money for something that costs very similar to what you might pay for ground transportation, we can save our customers a tremendous amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's awesome to hear. And it's very appealing to me. I live in Queens and yet JFK is also in Queens Yet somehow it still always takes me an hour just to get to JFK. So I'm sure there's more than a few of us listening to your last response. You say, Oh, my goodness, that sounds like a great alternative versus the MTA Blade does not only offer passenger transportation services well, but like you said, a growing medical transport segment. Let's talk the numbers though it reached $71.8 million in Q4 revenue growing 120%. Year over year. What is this segment entail? And why do you think you've been able to experience such high growth?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so just a quick clarification, the $71.8 million is the full-year revenue for 2022. But you're right. It's been growing triple digits year-over-year organically for the last several quarters, incredibly fast growth. And you know, the interesting thing about how we got started in medical, for better or for worse in New York City, we've always had 24/7 availability of crews, largely in case somebody wanted to go to Atlantic City in the middle of the night, which used to happen all the time. And we realized one day we've got all these aircrafts sitting around ready to go, incredibly affordable prices. Because we're flying them all the time to airports out to Long Island, we realized that we could actually help the hospitals here in New York, and we could provide them service to go pick up organs and get do it much more cost-effectively and much more quickly than any of the providers they've been using before. So we started just in our own home base here we're based in New York City, working with NYU Langone, we added Mount Sinai and we very quickly became the largest transporter of human organs here in the Northeast. And we realized it's the same aircraft for organ transportation. So quick primer on organ transportation. There's a group called UNOS here in the United States. This is the governing body that allocates organs to potential transplant recipients so that organization is going to say this donor could be a match with this recipient. And then they turn it over to the quarterback of any transplant mission, which is the transplant center or the hospital that is going to be putting that organ inside the recipient. So that is our customer. That is our credit. We don't have to deal with any insurance. We don't have to deal with reinsurance reimbursements. We're always getting paid from that hospital, that's our customer and they're generally two to three-year contracts. But where we really shine is all the same jets that we might be using for you to go between Palm Beach and New York City or the helicopters that we're using during the day to fly between JFK and Manhattan. Those same aircraft are what we utilize primarily at night to move organs for these hospitals. And you may or may not know, one of the biggest components of the cost of flying aircraft is the fixed costs, the salaries for the pilots, the liability insurance, and the lease payment you might pay as an operator to lease that aircraft from a lessor. Those are all costs that are borne by our network of third-party operators. But they also cost that if you fly more hours, you're now amortizing that fixed costs over more hours. So it actually costs you less to fly. So that's the magic of putting those two businesses together and Blade by having use cases during the day for our passengers. And use cases that are primarily at night for medical, we can offer the operators that fly on our behalf more hours, and we can eliminate some of their fixed costs, for example, they don't need customer service anymore, because we're doing all that mostly with our technology. And because they're flying that fixed costs over more hours, it costs everybody less to fly, they make more money, and we can pass through some savings to hospitals. And we have a very competitive product, we think the lowest-cost product in the United States to move organs for hospitals, and it allows them to go after more potential transplants. That's another really important point and our organ transportation business, because we're asset-light because we have aircraft distributed across the United States, ready 24/7. We can source an aircraft, that's not only the exact right size that a hospital needs at the exact right time, but increasingly at the exact right place. So it's a fragmented industry, most hospitals used to work with a mom-and-pop operator of a couple of aircraft that were based right near their hospital. The problem with that is that every trip needs to be a round trip. And a lot of times in organ transportation, you think you might pick up an organ and then pawn visual inspection, it's actually not going to be a match for the recipient. So if you're working with an operator that's based right near where you are, you're always going to have to pay for that full round-trip transportation, if you're working with Blade will have an aircraft on standby near the location where the donor is located, you can visually inspect that organ. And if it's not a match, you only pay a couple $1,000, you can imagine how overtime over a year, it costs the hospital so much less. And it also enables them to go after more organs. So you know, it's exciting that this is a great growing business. It's profitable for Blade on a segment-adjusted EBITA basis. But it's even more exciting for me and the team here that we have enabled hospitals to go after more organs than they otherwise might have been able to, because they have the confidence that not they're not going to be stuck with the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Will, I'd like to ask you a little bit about maybe some potential headwinds or challenges in this particular macroeconomic environment. Obviously, for all the talk about a recession, a lot of people are just sort of looking at the jobless claims and the numbers and the job cuts. And they're saying this a little bit more of a tech session or maybe a rich session. And given your kind of client base there. Are you seeing that kind of squeeze in terms of consumer spending among wealthier clientele, given some of the jobless numbers that we've seen across the country? And how, you know, some demographics of spenders may be hit more than others?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, well, look, we think we've built an incredibly resilient business on both sides of the house on the passenger and medical side. Obviously, on the medical side, it's hard to get more recession-proof than saving folk's lives by moving in organs, where you got one moment in time to get that to a recipient who needs it to save their life. But on the passenger side, we have extremely resilient customers, as we talked about even looking quarter to date as of our earnings call last week. For passenger, we're seeing a near doubling of our airport business in New York versus the prior year period, we had a record for airports here in New York, we've seen great results from being able to take price increases in some of our key markets, like New York to Long Island, where some routes we raise price up to 30%. We think we have great pricing power. We think we're targeting a unique group of people that's extremely resilient in any economic environment. And then the most important thing is right, we've got that asset light model. So if you look at our gross profit margin across the last several years, even through the pandemic, when of course, on the passenger side of the business, we saw a significant drop of volumes, what you saw is that our flight margins stayed very strong. That's because we don't have the fixed cost associated with flying that you would have if you owned a bunch of aircraft. So we're incredibly nimble. And if you ever did need to reallocate resources between medical and passenger or throttle capacity up or down, you'd be able to do that and still maintain really strong flight profit margins. Now, we haven't seen anything to suggest that there's any weakness in our flyer, but we're incredibly cool. afforded by the fact that we've got these two complementary business lines using the same aircraft assets to fly. And the asset-light model gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility. So I'm incredibly excited. I'm excited that we're still seeing growth, significant growth, particularly in markets like New York City. So so we're really feeling good at any macro environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin\u003c/strong\u003e: Absolutely. I do want to try and squeeze in these last two if I can first in the in the last quarter Blade completed its first test flights of an EVA, that's electrical vertical aircraft. You mentioned it a bit earlier with its partner Beta Technologies. Talk to us a bit more about EVA's and Blade's ambitions for this new aircraft, if you can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, we think this could be an incredible boost to the passenger and the medical business. On the medical side of the house. There are a lot of areas where you don't have access to rotorcraft, they're just too remote. And those machines are too expensive to be based on air all the time. And as a result, you might have a two-three hour drive to the nearest airport from a hospital where a donor is sitting, a heart only has four hours in transit. So it kind of takes them out of the running to get it anywhere except somewhere local. If you had a less expensive electric vertical aircraft or even a drone. Now you could go after organs that maybe you couldn't otherwise do on the passenger side of the business. Everything we're doing that 10-200 mile trip is specifically designed with electric vertical aircraft in mind. And the most important thing I can stress is that these aircrafts are quiet. The number one limiting factor in terms of creating new places that we can land is the noise that the community believes that helicopters could bring. By bringing an aircraft that's near silent and flight completely silent the moment after it shuts, it sits down because you can turn those rotors off immediately. Unlike a turbine holograph copter where they have to keep spinning, you can start adding new spokes onto our key hubs. So we have exclusive terminal infrastructure in places like New York, no one else has a heliport terminal at West 30 Street, East 34th street, you simply couldn't offer a service like ours in New York City, if you didn't have those exclusive terminals that we have. What we see from EVA is creating new places to fly to and from those key hubs that we had, if you had a heliport in Stamford, Connecticut, people could start commuting in, but it'd be very difficult to compete with us if you didn't have the infrastructure we have in New York City. So we're really employing a strategy of building those key hubs, those locations where urban air mobility can be profitable today with helicopters, building that moat in terms of customers that already fly the infrastructure that's exclusive to our technology that's specifically designed to operate this mission and a brand that's recognized around the whole world at this point so that when those electric vertical aircraft are ready for commercial use, we're already the market leader and we've got a huge head start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Finally, here Will, before I let you go, United Airlines previously invested $15 million into Air Mobility and also agreed to purchase 200 of its EVA's electrical air taxis. Talk to me about how Blade is viewing competition as an industry in terms of electrical air taxis and as the industry develops\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e As we've learned from our passenger and a medical business, you know, one size fits all does not apply to aviation, you need a different aircraft to fly an organ between New York and Boston than you might use to just fly that five minutes between JFK and Manhattan. So we're all about having a diversity of aircraft in our accessible fleet. And that's why we're staying in Switzerland and the electric vertical aircraft business, we're going to use the best aircraft for any given mission, our asset-light model allows us to pick the winners in terms of what aircraft is going to be most appropriate for each market, we're not putting a stake in the ground in terms of we have to use this aircraft here, this aircraft there. So we're very excited to work with all the electric vertical aircraft manufacturers, to the extent they create an aircraft that's going to work for our customers from a payload and cost perspective. So there's a lot still to learn about electric vertical aircraft. And Blade gives you the optionality, right? We've got customers, we've got them on roofs where we can make money, even with helicopters. And so if electric vertical aircraft are going to be slightly less expensive, which is what all the manufacturers today do, we can feel very confident that they should work well on the routes we're already operating. And we do not have our hands tied in terms of having to use one particular kind of aircraft because it's hard to know at this stage, who's going to be first to market and which aircraft is going to make the most economic sense. So we're trying to cast a wide net rather than pigeonhole ourselves with one particular manufacturer or one particular route, one particular place. So we think we're set up to be much more flexible than the competition and you know, at the end of the day, we have the customers and we have the passengers that are already flying. You can take a jog on the West Side Highway and you can see people getting into a Blade helicopter every 15-20 minutes. And we think that's going to make all the difference. Right on\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eAlright, that's Will Heyburn CFO of Blade. Will, thanks a lot for taking the time. It was a great conversation.

Before we dive into the nitty gritty and the details of their earnings reports. Can you just explain to anybody who might not be familiar with MoneyLion what you do?

So let's get into the earnings report from earlier this week. So on the earnings call, you reiterated three key takeaways for investors. I would love it if you could recap what those three key takeaways were for our listeners today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so let me just, I want to read something from the Fun Police or lawyers, which is that as we're going through the financials or anything that I'm talking about, unless it's otherwise stated, I'll be referring to our non-GAAP adjusted results. And so you can see the appendix in our earnings release available on our IRS site for any of our GAAP results and reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure. And then, of course, you can always find our latest earnings presentations on moneyline.com.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo with your question, in terms of the three key takeaways that we highlighted on our earnings call, the first was that we reached a significant milestone, which is we reached positive adjusted EBITDA in the month of December. This also marked our fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA improvement. And so we're really proud of this milestone we've been working towards optimizing growth and profitability. And as everyone can appreciate a really dynamic market environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe others that we announced that we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2023. There aren't many of us in this kind of competitive space that can say that. And it's another great milestone for us as we turn the quarter corner towards delivering really kind of profitable growth at scale. And then we also surprise the analyst community by being months ahead of our EBITDA targets. So in terms of our Q4 results, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of expectations at the 6 million adjusted EBITDA or negative Don number was an improvement from 32 million a year prior and Q4 ‘21. And this was really driven by the performance in our consumer business, seeing the continued benefits of a lot of the operating leverage that our business was built to realize as well as around 15 million of annualized run rate, fixed cost savings that we actioned during the fourth quarter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second takeaway that was important for our investors is that we added over a million total customers in Q4. And we did that at a remarkably low CAC, which you've probably been following us is really kind of one of the things that differentiate us, and that's under a $10 CAC. And so we've been able to grow while actually reducing our marketing spend, and specifically reducing it with the paid digital channel. So you know, when you look at the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, those channels are becoming increasingly expensive. And so we benefit from having a unique way in terms of driving our top funnel. And we do that by having over 30 million inquiries a quarter. You know, that gives us a tremendous number of customers data and importantly intent that we can then optimize to, as I said at the beginning of this match customers with the right suite of products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe third key takeaway is that we reached quarterly adjusted to be EBITDA of 92 million in Q4 of ‘22, and this is up 70%, over the prior year quarter. And so for the full year of 2022, we had an adjusted revenue that increased nearly 100%, year over year to 328 million. And so because of this kind of diversified consumer and enterprise business model, we're able to continue delivering really strong performance across economic cycles. And so that's really the kind of key three takeaways that we wanted our investors to take away from the business update that we provided yesterday.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Yeah, I appreciate all that insight. And I think that we'll get more into this consumer and enterprise product lineup in just a couple of minutes here. But before we do get to that, with all of these key takeaways in mind, knowing that there are some pretty impressive stats and you know, some important numbers that you and your team shared earlier this week, I would love if you could just explain the context behind all of this, you know, not necessarily how you got there, but more so what does this mean? What do these big three key takeaways mean, for investors - for adding value for investors? Tell me a little bit about that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so when you look at why these matters, so much for us is one, it's unique for a company that has kind of both our growth trajectory and profitability trajectory, to meet the needs of our customers in such a meaningful way. And so whether our customers are experiencing, you know, times of need, or they have times of excess, we're able to deliver for them, either our first party or our third party products. And so when you think about the context of this, we exited the year, with 6.5 million total customers. And so our definition of customers are monetized customers, as opposed to just those that kind of browse our platform. And that's important, because it means that we're going to be delivering value to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second reason, when you look at the number of products that were taken by those customers, it's nearly 13 million. And so that's a really nice blend of both first party products that we provide, as well as third party products. And so it means they're actually meeting the needs of our consumers. And then we ended the year with over 1000 enterprise partners. And we'll touch upon this a bit more later, when you look at what we have, from an enterprise business perspective, we have one of the leading financial marketplaces out there. And so that means that we're helping our customers kind of get matched with product providers so that we're meeting their needs authentically. And then we amassed over 33 million unique customer profiles across our platform. And so what's really important about that is if you look at the recurring revenue profile of both of our consumer and enterprise businesses, it means that our customers are coming back to us, because we're actually helping them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo on the consumer side, for example, over 75% of our revenue comes from our historical cohorts, whether it's kind of pre 2019, or 2020, or 2021, and even 2022. Every day that we wake up, over 75% of our revenue are coming from customers that we acquired historically. And then on the enterprise side, we have a similar type of profile, we have over 80% of our enterprise customers that represent revenue – recurring revenue that we are realizing. And so what does that mean, again, we wake up every day, and we are generally generating over 80% of our revenue in the enterprise side from historical cohorts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen just digging down into the customers. You know, the thing that we have been proud about doing within MoneyLion is having some of the leading unit economics. So we've kind of talked about the customers that we added in the fourth quarter, we added just over a million of them. And we did that, as I mentioned earlier at about an $8 CAC. And so if you went back a year that you know, our CAC was in the 20s, and every quarter, we've been able to improve our CAC and kind of keep it at that low level, because of the unique type of funnel that we have. That then translates into a two month payback period. And importantly, we're able to do that at a really strong ARPU, and so our ARPU was at over $60. And again, while we're spending less than $10, to acquire them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat. So you know, with all these numbers in mind, and noting, especially to your final point, you just made here the trend that these numbers seem to be following and these metrics seem to be following, they appear to be pretty significant for the money line and for the future of your business. And I'm curious about the general circumstances in which these numbers were tallied, you know, you think about the macro climate, the economic circumstances that any business would be facing in most of last year, certainly at the end of last year. I'm curious about how those macro circumstances impacted the financials that you reported and also, you know, how they might impact the way that you go about the future quarters. You know, once we get past the quarters that you were, of course reporting on earlier this week. Tell me a little bit about your perspective and your take on everything that's happening in the macro sense and how it impacts your business?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that is a great question. You know, one of the things that's unique about where we are positioned is we have a really interesting window into the American consumer. We also have an interesting window into a lot of the market participants on the enterprise side, right? The kind of big channels where customers are looking for products, as well as those big companies that are delivering those financial products. And so with those windows, where we kind of have a good sense of how the consumer is performing and behaving. And I think what we see right now is they're, they're pretty resilient still. And we're uniquely positioned because of this mix between our consumer and enterprise business. So on the consumer side, we're continuing to see consumers having a lot of demand for financial products and demand for credit. And demand for the kind of higher yield savings that they're seeing, you know, are very different than the type of yield that they receive in their deposit accounts, one, two, three years ago.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then on the enterprise side, you know, channel partners are still seeing a lot of consumers spending time looking for ways to kind of improve their financial lives. We have seen, you know, some headwinds, from the kind of product providers where just kind of given the raising rate environment, you know, they're having to step back or tighten their risk box, which means it just isn't as much available, as we kind of saw in late Q3 and certainly part of Q4 of ‘22 customers having access to that. And so I think what's been important is having, for us, both a consumer business and an enterprise business allows us to be able to continue to hit our financial targets, because they kind of work as almost a hedge where what we've seen with the consumer side is we're able to kind of drive more and more kind of transaction fees, those type of direct deposit interchange revenue lines, as we kind of saw some headwinds, as I said, with the enterprise side of the business. With that position, just really to your question about what it means for the future, it means that we'll be able to continue to execute and realize the momentum that we've been having. If you look at the overall mix of our business, from an enterprise and consumer perspective, you know, consumer is about 65% of the revenue mix in enterprise is about 35%. And that's a slight shift more towards consumer relative to what we were expecting, you know, six months ago, we thought we'd start trending more and more towards 50-50. But again, that's a benefit for us, as we start to see that the shift or the tailwinds that we see in the consumer side, tend to offset some of the headwinds that we see on the enterprise side.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotally and noting, to your point that this could, in some ways, behave as a hedge that you have these two forks in the business. I'm curious about how, you know, it might be what the experience might be building both a consumer and an enterprise part of the business, in what could be construed as, as volatile economic circumstances or a volatile economic environment? Is that a difficulty for MoneyLion? And if so, tell me about how you try to, you know, establish these two business entities or, you know, I don't want to suggest that they're separate entities, but two parts of your business that serve a different customer? Is it difficult to develop both of those and to mature both of those at the same time, knowing that the economic climate is not the most hospitable?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, another great question, which so, I think fortunately, for us, it's all built. You know, certainly there are always optimizations and improvements that you're doing. But we are, you know, easily the most full featured offering out there from a financial bank perspective that exists. So for some companies that might have a feature as an entire company, we have that embedded, it's just a feature. So for example, like a round ups. And so if you kind of looked at the MoneyLion app, from a consumer perspective, it's fully built, it's the most full featured product that exists out there, we encourage people to download the app and play around with it, it's free, you get access to incredible kinds of content. And then the more that you interact with it, the more personalized it becomes, and the more that we're able to help people\u0026nbsp; access the right mix of financial products. And so, you know, from an enterprise perspective, you know, there are always ways to continue to improve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo to give people a little more transparency into what that means from an enterprise perspective, we are a network and we're a technology company. What we help our channel partners do is we allowed them to be able to have a very flexible, different ways in which they can basically use our technology, you can kind of have an embedded piece of software, we can host an entire white label type of site for you, you can kind of have a mobile version of it. And that allows our channel partners to kind of optimize the way in which they want to have customer experience to meet their needs. And however, basically, those channel partners are kind of routing customers to us, or people that have high intent to us, on the other side of the equation, are our very fast set of product partners. And again, we have deep integration, and we give them software that allows them to kind of tweak the way in which they want to see customers, the type of customers, they want to see the frequency to help them meet their needs. And so for that perspective, again, that's already all built. Of course, we're always looking at ways to optimize the funnel, we're always looking at ways to add more and more new types of enterprise web services that we can deliver to those partners.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut you know, when we look at the macro environment ahead, and it's incredibly difficult to kind of look forward and think about what that macro can unveil for our business. But we're confident because whichever way the market kind of tilts over the next coming quarters, we're going to either kind of realize our plan, or we're going to be able to take advantage of credit partners and the credit boxes, the risk boxes that will widen back up. And that allows us to kind of further you know, meet that on that demand that we're seeing. It's increasing quarter over quarter from the client side with products that meet their needs. So we think that at a minimum for us, we execute against our plan, we get to EBITDA positive over the year, and with some tailwinds, and with some kind of macro positive news, you know, the kind of back after the year we get to kind of spring load into outperformance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, makes a ton of sense. And I think this answer specifically speaks to some of MoneyLion’s potential competitive advantages moving into the future. So with that in mind, I would love to just hear your perspective broadly about the future of the FinTech space, what is exciting to you right now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think what's exciting, and we're excited because we kind of play a really unique position within the FinTech space, which is I think, some people try to kind of pigeonhole us into being, you know, a neobank, or patroness into being, you know, a lender or petitioners into being kind of a robo-advisor. We are all of the above. But importantly, we're really just that interface layer to the customer. And so what we are able to do is really kind of play that kind of Swiss role, where we are a data company and a technology company that is able to take our customer and give them access to the right product. And that can be a product from any FinTech provider. So what's exciting about us as there is, more and more FinTech players are entering the space, they're always kind of driving innovation. And we get to take advantage of that by making those products available to our customers, whether it's an insurance, whether it's in mortgages, whether it's an auto refi, even when you start to look at some of the things that are kind of very budget intensive, so travel, spend on a car, things like that, we're even able to give our customers access to those types of, of non financial products through our partners, through our overall Money Lions membership or while membership. So it's a really exciting place to be in a space to be because we hope there are more and more market entrants into the FinTech space, and specifically on the product side so that we can make that available to our customer base.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and we're certainly excited to watch how FinTech unfolds in the coming months and years. Certainly, it's been a very interesting past couple of weeks. I shouldn't even be that generous – the past couple of days following the FinTech space. So we are going to have to check back, Rick, and see how things pan out for the next couple of months and years. So with that, I want to thank our wonderful guests today, Rick Correia, CFO at MoneyLion for his time. Rick, thank you so much.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. I look forward to being back next quarter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course. And thank you again to our partners at MoneyLion who made today's show possible. We will be back next month with even more news and updates from the FinTech economy. Thank you so much for listening, and I'll see you next time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["EXEC_Q_A"],"sponsorDetailsDto":{"sponsor":{"id":"4AZld8DNW0SHRqXId0wbVmvxC5OfvNaE","name":"MoneyLion","disclosure":"","imageUrl":""},"symbols":["ML"]},"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"902e27b4-f7a8-41d1-b4b6-d03c446c5ffa","username":"kinsey","displayName":"Kinsey Grant","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/Sosi4hWQpiDT3ZXndA3KXkEbz0Mpi2fi-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"host of Thinking Is Cool","followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"7236716d-cac0-42e1-b575-98ae067aa0eb","username":"rickcorreia","displayName":"Rick Correia","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/nO9LTaZAkkxhrXlF4tkJcbJlGrUbU3E6-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"CFO at MoneyLion","followedByMe":false,"following":false}],"stocks":[{"symbol":"ML","name":"MoneyLion"}],"slug":"https://app.public.com/live/stock-market/interview-with-moneylions-cfo","uniqueId":"m2kA8FGqPRsJAnX6dr9Zsm7gV9TLMXOP","status":"PUBLISHED","linkedIds":["nw96ZGLbPoxnVotZydc80nXCMYoY9GUn","XZ6CgnSgEC1SWKGctrmeZ9353WDgj1SL"],"cta":{"buttonText":"Sign up","title":"Interview with MoneyLion's CFO","subtitle":"Invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptos, alts, and more.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Hello, everyone, and good afternoon and welcome to Public Live this Thursday, March 9th. I am your host, Kori Hale and today folks, we're going to be discussing Spotify’s recent Stream On event and be updating you on Metas year of efficiency as well as other big tech news. And I'm excited because this is one of my favorite guests we have on the show with us today. It's Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. Mark is also if that wasn't enough, and it is but he is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 times stock picking lessons for one of Wall Street's top tech analysts. And of course, right here on Public, we're doing book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public alive handle. Alright, Mark, welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e It's good to be back, Kori.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e We're always happy to have you join us. And of course, you break down as some of these big tech names on Wall Street, as I mentioned, and we got to talk about Spotify. The streaming platform recently hosted its Stream On event and announced many new features planned for the app. For those of us who maybe did not catch that announcement, could you provide some insight into some of the standout features that were discussed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMark Mahaney: Okay, I think this was their fifth annual Stream On event. It's kind of their product. It's like their customer event, but it's really kind of a product development event. I guess that's what it is. It's it's like, it's like Apple's worldwide developer conference. Now not nearly as impactful or meaningful as that, but it's just this is where they roll out their latest innovations. So there was some new disclosure to the founder, Daniel Eck, the CEO announced that they are now over half a billion monthly visitors, which means that monthly average users, which means that they're now a little bit ahead of their guidance for the March quarter, it's a small thing for the financial folks out there. Second is they disclose that Spotify recommendations are powering more than half of users streams. And why that matters is you know, the more that Spotify is music, people who listen to Spotify, listen to curated music, rather than just going on there and saying, you know, I want this song by Taylor Swift, the extent to which they kind of give the wheel, give the mic, give the turntable that's the right one, Kori, give the turntable to Spotify and say, play me something interesting. That means that Spotify becomes more influential, and that means that artists then want to pay to kind of influence To that influence, or that they're willing to advertise, you know that that creates more of an opportunity for them, you know, the, the retailer who simply just fulfills, doesn't generate margins as nice as the retailer who actually suggests and can and can influence tastes and patterns and things like that. And then the last thing that I thought was interesting is they have a new home feed that's coming out. And I think it's a little bit what I would call the TikTok isation of Spotify. So you're gonna see more TikTok-like features short-form video kind of right up front, you can see sort of a little bit of endless feed is the wrong word, but you're gonna see some of that you're gonna see more than just the static feed when you start. So these are all going to all these little nuances that sort of improve, they also talked about an AI DJ, I'm not sure we're going to really notice a difference, but we'll try it out. And then a new ad format, that's kind of a small video ad format, anything that generates ad revenue for Spotify is going to be good for their gross margins. So those are the features that came out of Spotify’s Stream On on event yesterday,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark, I love that you brought up actually a plethora things that I want to really quickly piggyback off of. And also, we probably have lots of Swifties in our audience, and they probably were like, Mark, we only play Taylor Swift straight through. We don't need any sort of DJ for that. But the interesting thing about what I are what came to my mind was Payola back in the day, which I might be dating myself back in the radio days, when radio was a massive thing, right in artists, more so record labels are paying radio DJs right to play their particular artists. Are you saying then since there's more of this suggesting type of thing that's going to happen with Spotify going forward that there could be some streaming Payola-ish version at some point?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, you're using a very loaded word and Payola and you know, in some senses, that's what it is. But in some senses, maybe we need to rethink it a little bit. So when you use Google search engine, do you think about all those paid ads within Google as Payola? In other words, you know, when when you do a search for, you know, tickets to March Madness games, basketball games, or when you do a search for, you know, Hawaiian, you know, budget, airfare, and you get these paid results in there. I mean, that's essentially I've thought about this as Google's I'm sorry, as Spotify, Googling it search results, you go on there, and you look at today's top country hits, or today's you know, whatever hit it, and hip hop, I think they've got it, they've got something, you know, for a Christian country, I mean, they've got every possible genre you can imagine in there. And if you're an emerging artist, and if you're in a label, you know, this is like, this is a target-rich environment. I mean, these are people listening to your genre, you're a new artist, you know, like to you to here's an opportunity for you to advertise your song so that Italy shows up somewhere in the queue. Now, many people may not listen to your music, but at least here's a chance to market or advertise. And so that's kind of how we think about it. And so I don't know if that answers your question. But that's what that's the exact intent behind Spotify. And what they've done is given labels the ability to market to advertise their newest labels, their newest features, their newest artists, one of the world's largest, most influential music platforms, if you can make it on Spotify, you can make it anywhere. Spotify makes or breaks artists. And then sorry, but that is true, given how they've got half a billion people who listen to the surface, and probably 250 million who listen to it on a daily basis. There's no music listening service outside of YouTube, that's any bigger any more influential than that. And so that's how I think about and I've always thought about it as a great opportunity last year, I think they generate about $200 million in revenue a little bit more than that, from this what is what I call this advertising revenue. I think it's good for Spotify’s business model. And I also do think it creates opportunities for us of the artists that are on Spotify, here's a chance for them to here's a chance for them to promote their work their blood, sweat and toil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, you know what, Mark that makes me think what else do you think is good for Spotify his business model because right now you're holding a price target of $185 on their stock with an outperform rating. What is it beyond that? The fact that they're getting this half a billion monthly active users that really, you know, has you all over at Evercore ISI so pro Spotify?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I am pro Spotify. I was pro-Spotify last year Kori I think you remember that. And the stock tanked. I thought we were going to have an inflection point last year we didn't. And I thought I meant that in terms of gross margins. This is why I like Spotify here and I may be wrong again. You know, but I'm trying to get it right this time. So one, we know that the multiple has come down dramatically on this one This thing goat used to go at four or five, six times, he'd be, you know, enterprise value to sales. Now we're sub two times like that's cheaper than Netflix is cheaper than, well, sort of online dating companies which are somewhat similar. I mean, this is a subscription business and an advertising business, although it's mostly a subscription business. So I think it's cheap. I think the estimates have been de-risk. I think the multiple has then been de-risked. They've started taking some cost actions, they probably overbuilt like a lot of tech companies. So they've been taking some cost actions. But why I particularly like the setup this year, is that I think you're finally at a place where you're going to cut back on some of that podcast investment, heavy spending that they've had. So I think you're finally going to get gross margins to move up. For low gross margin businesses. When you see gross margins move up, it's almost always a major catalyst for the stock. Second is they are likely to implement a price increase their biggest competitors, Apple and Amazon have both implemented a price increase. So it gives it kind of raises the umbrella a little bit and allows them to raise prices. Usually, that's a good thing for companies and for and for stocks. And then the third thing is Kori, last year, they had a record number of new users globally they added the number was something like 70 million. And what typically happens with Spotify is people come on as free users. And then over time, they kind of migrate a decent number of migrate over to be paid subscribers. So if the pick of the record MAU growth last year converts into paid subscriber growth, boom, I got my third catalyst for this year. So that's why I like it. I think the thing can recover to sort of like two times EV to sales. I just don't think that's an aggressive multiple. I know we're in a tough market for for growth equities. This year. This is a company that's been consistently free cash flow positive, admittedly a very small, minimal level, but I do like it and I think it's it's the leading way to play music streaming worldwide. So that's why we that's why we're pitching Spotify is one of our top longs this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e See Mark just because you were wrong last year, that doesn't mean you're wrong. This year. We're not even before three months into the year and Spotify obviously doing pretty well. However, competition this year for Spotify, right also completely ticking up. This is no pun intended specifically with TikTok, right. This is a major competitive threat. Spotify has, you know, acknowledged this, you know, as part of their business model the company is working to obviously expand its streaming globally. TikTok has already said that, do you actually see Tik Tok as a threat to Spotify? Especially with maybe the legal issues by legal I mean regulatory issues around TikTok in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori I may be wrong, but I don't think so. I think the bigger competitive risk really is Apple Music. YouTube music, Amazon music. Those are kind of the more direct So, let's see. Yeah, I think I'm not sure the competition is greater. But yes, TikTok has got a, you know, huge audience worldwide. It's one of those things where can the brand really be stretched? Are people going to really think about like, TikTok is a wonderful experience for you know, for consumers. It's just highly entertaining, addictive, maybe, but also truly highly entertaining. But it's a different type of entertainment than music. And I'm in one of the problems that TikTok is apparently having is getting the rights that Spotify spent a lot of time getting from the labels. So I just, I'm not at all sure that TikTok is going to come out and directly compete with, with Spotify. I'll take the other side on that I may be wrong. I worry about the other companies. But I've just noticed in the seven years I've been running surveys on Spotify, every year, they seem to gain more share of ear can I say that, share of ear you know, like their their share of people listening to streaming music on Android devices. And by the way on Apple devices has pretty consistently risen over the last couple of years. So they're doing something right the real issue on the stock and why it hasn't done anything since its IPO is or direct listing is the business model and people want to see the gross margins go up people want to see them start generating substantial amounts of free cash flow they generate minimal amount but let's get chunky. Let's get a lot of free cash flow. I think they can start gapping up that gross margin this year start growing it I think 10 People can start believing again that there can be sizable free cash flow and that could cause the rewriting in the stock to go up this year. That's why I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e All right. No, I I'm with you on that Mark. I want to shift really quickly while we have some time though and cover another big tech company which is Facebook's parent company Meta they're entering into their year of efficiency are since entering I guess it's continuing as the social media giant is expected to layoff thousands more or employees as early as this week. Might I also add it is not lost on me that a company that's shifting into a year of efficiency, which is away from the metaverse after they changed the parent company name to Meta is a lot of questions in my mind around that. However, this is the second largest scale cut these layoffs by Meta. How many more can investors expect as part of this year of efficiency?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I do think it's necessary the year of efficiency. You know, we there's two factors that are going on here. One is that overall demand trends are softening for macro economic reasons. And so layoffs aren't fun. I've gone through them, you know that they're painful for everybody involved, especially if you're one of those people getting laid off. But you know, when times get tough, we all the households tighten their belts and companies need to tighten their belts. And one way you do that, is you unfortunately have to let go some of your employees. The other thing, though, that's one factor. But the other one that Jim maybe just as material and maybe more so is that there clearly are some companies that overbuilt post the COVID crisis, I think Amazon was one I think, Meta was one if you were to go back and look at the revenue growth between 2019 and 2022. And then the OPEX growth, your operating expense growth, you'll see there's a couple of companies that really stick out that they grew their expenses more than their revenue, even though revenue shot up materially between 2019 and 2022, the expenses grew even more. And I think these companies sort of assumed that there was this positive inflection and demand for the services that we kind of continue on for many, many years. That didn't happen. It's not like we've gained, it's not like we've reverted to 2019. It's just that the growth rates have kind of more normalized, rather than just kind of kept it accelerating level. Anyway, all of that is Meta was one of those companies, demand trends are softening for online advertising, no question about it as they are for all marketing spend, and this company over hired, and it's probably the right thing for them to do to take these layoffs. I you know, I think what's been reported recently, I think that is probably going to happen. There's enough there's enough smoke there. There's got to be some hiring fire. I think that's good. I think that actually was a surprisingly good pun. And then I'm going to use that in the note thank you, Kori. And then, but yeah, so I think that's happened. And I think it helps, what investors want to see is defend the bottom line, you know, you can't control what's going to happen to you know, ad marketers, and how much they're going to spend in a recession, you can control your cost basis, and show me that you're going to do that show me your grown-up company. And Zuckerberg kind of weaved and waved a little bit last year. But I think he got to the I think he finally I think most of the signals he gave were it Yes, I'm a mature company, CEO. I'm a CEO, I'm a mature CEO of a company, it may be a mature company. And we need to be much more careful about expenses. And it's not growth at all costs. And when he started to do that, I think he's been rewarded by the market. And I think there's more of that coming. And I also think that the revenue growth trends are going to improve at Facebook because I think they're improving their ad tracking their ad attribution models. And I think they're going to be able to better monetize reels, which I think has turned out to be phenomenally successful for both Instagram and Facebook in terms of new users and more engagement. So I really like Meta here. I think it's still cheap at 14 times earnings. And I think there's 50% upside in the stock. So it's actually my number one pick right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow, number one pick. I didn't know that's where you were going with that mark. But that's that's a strong conviction there. Okay. Number one pick, you know what I was thinking to in the broader tech scheme, something I'd love to get your insights on. We don't have time to do it today. So we'll have to have another session. But I really want to pick your brain around chat GPT around Microsoft's login strategy, how you see that playing into revenue. What does that do to Google? Especially because you brought up ads of the like and how that all could really up in certain business revenue lines across different tech companies. I don't know if you've given that any thought but I'd love to hear what you have to say on that next time around. Next time around. All right, everyone. This was a great session. By the way I love this and I we always love when Mark comes on and shares his insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the interset internet research team over at Evercore ISI don't forget about the book giveaway that we're doing DM us and Public Live handle today.

Joining us today is Paul Graves, CEO of Livent. Livent is a lithium manufacturer powering a range of technologies that impact our everyday lives, including the revolution in electric vehicle batteries and mobile devices. With that, Paul, thanks very much for joining us.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks, Ann. Good morning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's start off with a brief overview of what Livent does. If you just break down the technology and applications of your products, that'd be super helpful.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, sure. You know, I'm sure we're gonna get into a little bit of conversation about what exactly lithium is, but Livent is the former FMC lithium, its predecessor company, started in the 1940s. So we've been around a long time, we basically make all the major forms of lithium, so the major funds lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, lithium chloride, lithium metal, and have done for many, many years. Our primary product, though, is lithium hydroxide, which is a form of lithium that is used in the manufacture of that higher nickel content batteries that you see in Teslas and other premium vehicles. So the bulk of our business today, at least, is lithium hydroxide.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI feel like I'm back at school in learning the periodic table with all the different formulations. So lots to keep up with. Tell us then a little bit about the partnerships that you have - Tesla, you mentioned BMW and General Motors, to what capacity are you guys working with the automotive and battery manufacturers?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEach of these manufacturers and basically, most manufacturers, frankly, outside China today, are prioritizing batteries that are using a technology that is a high nickel battery. The reason they do that is simply more energy density and just the profile of that battery is more appropriate for what they're trying to do in terms of extended range, etc. To make those batteries as I said, they need lithium hydroxide. And the reason that they partner with us and we partner with them from their perspective, they're just very few places in the world where you can acquire lithium hydroxide of a quality and of a grade that is usable in a battery application, the process of qualifying can take a year. In fact, we know that one of our competitors spent almost six years getting qualified into a specific battery application.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo this is not a substitutable product and so you have to form partnerships. The same is true, by the way, for us because every single battery manufacturer wants slightly different characteristics in their lithium hydroxide. So also, they can't just run out and buy this product over the counter on a market. They can't they can't pick it up anywhere and just use it. There are some pretty large liability issues for battery failures for OEMs, and we've seen that in the past. And so this idea of having a very reliable, high quality supply of lithium hydroxide is really important to these OEMs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen we look at the underlying demand then for license products and we focus in on this EV and market how dependent in your mind Paul is us, EV adoption on government policies specifically?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I think most EV adoption around the world is due to some form of government intervention, whether it's industrial policy in China, or whether it’s regulatory policy in Europe, particularly climate policy, or whether it's something in the middle, frankly, in the U.S. So every country is dependent on that. If the question is, how important is the US market to the global EV industry, it's easily the third out of the three major economic groupings in terms of lithium demand without me read your mind, with China clearly being way ahead of everybody else, Europe catching up quickly and the U.S.\u0026nbsp; very much in third place.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk about China then Paul has to start the year. We've seen headline declines and Evie demand numbers in China lithium prices in China down by nearly a third relative to November highs. What does that mean for your business? And is this a concerning trend?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I'm going to tell you, the data just frankly, isn't reliable. We don't see prices falling in China, we haven't seen that. It's really a function of there's a lot of there's a lot of forces at work. But looking at a reference price in China, whether it's a fast market and SMM or whoever it may be, is trying to capture a marginal trade in a lithium product that is very rarely representative of the broader market. And I think you may have seen our earnings, you know, we're guiding the way that our average realized prices, is going to be significantly up year over year and we've certainly seen that in January.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the same is true of EV sales. We always see a dip in January in China because of the lunar holidays. We just saw February data a day or two ago and EV sales in February were up 40% year over year. So we just don't see this dip in sales that everybody else is speaking to. And we certainly don't see any evidence of a reduction in demand for lithium products as a result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e And just to put this in context, we live in what is the business's exposure to the Chinese market at a macro level?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, almost every battery maker today is producing a significant proportion of its cathodes – cathode materials in China, I think it's something like 80-85%, so for a lithium producer, it's extremely difficult to have no China exposure. Our business tends to be though, with Western applications for those cathodes. So we may supply them lithium hydroxide from our U.S.. plant which largely will go to Korea or Japan, or will supply from our China plant which will largely be processed in China, but the resulting cathode or battery or cell is leaving China and ending up in a western OEM.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk a little bit about some headline news that hit last week poor the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker contemporary Amperex Technology announced it was changing its pricing strategy and signing contracts with EV makers at “discounted prices.” \u003c/span\u003eWe saw lithium stocks including Livent you know, take a bit of a hit following that news. Could you just talk a little bit about your reaction to what is this something that's shaking up the market? Or is this a temporary hit to supply demand dynamics?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I think the move in the share price, it shows you how emotional investors are about lithium, unfortunately. There's not a lot of analytics behind the way we trade on a daily basis. It’s clear what CATLR have offered is first and foremost, this offer is only as far as we can tell to Chinese OEMs. So it's not an offer to anybody else. Secondly, that OEM must commit to buy over 70% of their batteries from CATL. In order to achieve that, and then they will price the battery as though lithium is at I think for lithium carbonate $30 equivalent. CATL is frankly largely a carbonate based battery producer, not hydroxide, we don't have a massive amount of exposure to CATL. We do have some - not to any Chinese manufacturers that we're aware of.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'd also point out that in 2022 Livent’s average realized price for lithium wasn't $30 it was lower than that. And so it's not like $30 is suddenly this catastrophic price. If you go back a couple of years, the industry really wasn't expecting to see pricing north of $20 for any sustainable period. So for CATL to say that now in the long run, they're gonna guarantee $30 I mean, to me, it just fundamentally is an acknowledgment and an admission that the historically low prices of lithium are not coming back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo there's been an upward rebasing that's interesting. You know electric vehicles\u0026nbsp; have really captured the imagination of the market, and particularly here on Public. We see a lot of interest in that use case, but live it when you actually go and read about the company, your products are using so many more end markets, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, take us a little bit through some of those other end markets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's interesting if you go back, not even six or seven years, we IPO’d in 2018. And the bulk of our business was not into automotive applications. And I think it was not until 2021 that it actually tipped over the edge. Even today in energy storage applications, EVs globally are between 55 and 60% of total installed capacity on a gigawatt hour basis. So EVs while they're \u0026nbsp; the biggest part of the energy storage industry, there's 40% or so that is non EV and application. For us, we have a little unusual business and I told you the beginning we have all the products and the lithium chloride and lithium metal chain, which by the way is the key to future solid state batteries will be the lithium metal side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eToday, lithium metal is largely used in a product we make up utility. Put any chemist on the phone. And you'll get excited about utility for some bizarre reason. But it's a product that's used to manufacture lots of other stuff, everything from drugs, polymers, a whole bunch of synthesis applications, it's got very, very broad applications that makes about a third of our revenue today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen I look at your business pool, and folks can find this in your earnings results, in 2022 numbers, it looks like revenue came in at $813 million adjusted EBITDA at $367 million. So there's heft and scale to your business that's been engaging in a number of capacity expansion projects. Can you talk a little bit for us about what it is like to be undertaking expensive capital intensive construction projects in a rising rate environment?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's an interesting challenge for certainly being more profitable helps us fund this. We also have no net debt, we have about 200 million of cash on our balance sheet today. Largely, frankly, because customers are stepping up for companies like Livent that are credible, that can actually have demonstrated that we can actually producing usable lithium chains, they're willing to commit capital to help us expand. Expanding is hard, lithium is incredibly difficult to produce, because it really, really has two steps to it. And the vast majority of expansions or even companies out there with lithium in the name actually will never produce any usable lithium, they'll produce an intermediate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat we're trying to build is a fully integrated resource all the way through the chemical plant operations. We do that today, through our resource in Argentina. Our resource in Argentina was about 4,200 meters or 13,000 feet above sea level. So it's incredibly remote and there’s villages 110 kilometers away. And we are trying to put over a billion dollars of capital into expanding that mine and it just takes a long time. A lead time for items in every industry, but certainly because of the EV boom, the same is true of nickel or copper, there's a lot of overlap in material, it can take us two or three years to actually get pieces of equipment delivered. So it's an arduous and complicated process, to be perfectly honest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then just the last question for you, Paul, which touches on this issue of policy, you've talked about your footprint in China, you've just touched on your footprint in Argentina. How much.. and this is really at the industry level not necessarily at the moment level, how much are you seeing impetus, at least from a policy perspective to do more in your production process here in the United States?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e It's a mixed bag and a mixed message. I think it's fair to say at the federal level, there's a desire to bring as much of the value on shore. The value if you think about the chain starts in mining run through chemical processing into manufacturing of cell components to the cells the cell packed and ultimately the vehicle. And I think it's probably far too fair to say that most policy starts at the vehicle and works its way backwards. And in terms of its desire to have the actual production on shore, there's a debate about whether they really want mining in the U.s. and that's certainly the case at the local level.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen you get into states or local communities we do get huge push backs as an industry or in the mining industry about mining in the U.S. It’s different in Canada but in the U.S., it's not entirely clear to me that there's a big policy commitment to the mining. They do want the chemical process and we have a site at Bessemer city in North Carolina where we produce lithium hydroxide. We just built another 5,000 ton plant there and we've committed to build another 15,000 ton plant there. So there is definitely commitment to that but the material that feeds that plant will ultimately come from Argentina, not from a minor the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLots going on in the industry, everyone that was Paul Graves, CEO of Livent.

I'm your host Connor Round and I'm so happy to be here with you today to discuss the key themes in AI and the industries that it can bring innovation and growth to. I'm thrilled to welcome my guest today, Ivana Delevska, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Spear Invest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks for having me, Connor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to start off, you know, we're here to talk about artificial intelligence. It's an opportunity that has use cases beyond the human imagination. So just to start off when considering business applications of AI, could you help investors understand what industries and sectors you see greatly benefit from the innovations in the space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sounds great. Connor so many people under appreciate the fact that AI today is already a $100 billion industry and it's still in the very early innings. The main applications that we see it used in today would be for consumer technologies. So it would be for like recommenders in cases like TikTok or e-commerce where you're getting recommended products to buy. So that's one of the largest applications that we see today. But looking forward, we think AI will be transformational for many industries, traditionally industrials, automotive, life sciences. We think it's really going to have a transformative impact for the broader industrial complex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVery interesting. And could you just break down the AI capabilities that you see within the social media space?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, yeah, so it's interesting social media. Previously, all of the innovation or all of the use cases in AI were based on this recommender model. So basically, companies like TikTok would in-house train their their models to be able to tell based on few data points on videos that you watch, they're going to be able to form a whole profile about you, and then be able to, to recommend you other videos, and they can be really addictive as most people, most people have seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's kind of the main use case today. Now, the new thing in AI is this transformer model, which was the concept or the paper was written and introduced in 2016. But you've really seen these models just getting trained, these large language models. So Chat GPT, is one application of this large language model, it's based on a model called GPT 3 that was introduced in 2021. So a lot of people are excited about the applications of Chat GPT today, but I will highlight that this is just one kind of flavor of the opportunity that we see going forward.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, I'm actually happy you brought up chat GPT that was just gonna go right into that. Apart from it kind of just expanding and, you know, breaking out into the scene very quickly. How do you see other companies reacting in the space? Do you see Google coming out with a new search engine capability? I'd love to hear your opinion on that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so we see Microsoft and Google, as potentially being leaders on the language side, Microsoft has maybe a head start, they've invested quite a bit here. And we've seen quite a lot from them. They're behind the GPT 3 language model, but they also recently announced an even newer model with even more parameters, 530 billion parameters, so we're gonna see a lot more from them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGoogle has been pretty quiet. They were maybe the leader several years ago. So we are waiting to hear what's going to come out of them. Investors believe that they have something, but it's kind of TBD. So as of right now, those are the two that are going to be leaders in the lead on the language model side. But it's very important for investors to realize that when you invest, you don't necessarily just want the direct beneficiary over trend, there is going to be a lot of investment in the infrastructure beyond behind like, behind AI. So for Microsoft, it's not just on the Bing side that they can introduce Chat GPT and kind of help jumpstart their business, but they're really going to benefit on the cloud side as well. So from an investment perspective, right now, we're finding better risk rewards in investing in the infrastructure. So it would be semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity as well. So yeah, so basically, the point here is beware of value traps, right? You don't want to invest in something that will get competed away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. And just to keep on Chat GPT, a lot of the hype has brought excitement to firms. And it kind of seems to be a similar trend to that of the crypto boom in 2021, with BuzzFeed announcing Chat GPT similar implications. Just wanted to know, do you see this as maybe a trend that will die down? Or is this something that we can expect to last?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell ChatGPT specifically, what you will need to see is people building things that are going to be useful on it. So specifically, for us, we're looking for maybe broader opportunities than that. But AI is a trend that is definitely not going to die down. As I mentioned before, it's already a $100 billion dollar industry. So whether Chat GPT takes off or not, it’s not really going to have..it will have some implications on AI but it's not really going to have broad implications for AI, if that makes sense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDefinitely and as you said, it is a $100 billion industry already. But in order to rev up innovation in this space further, much hardware and infrastructure will be required, such as the need for, you know, the much reliance semiconductor industry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat types of semiconductors, so we could just help investors understand, are required for building out AI, and how much of the industry is dedicated to its face?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, so, so thanks for asking that question, Connor. So basically, in order to train these models, you need GPUs. And that's why companies like Nvidia produce these today. And basically GPUs allow computers to do parallel operations and the reason why people are all of a sudden so excited about AI versus say a year or two ago is that prior to the transformer model, and prior to this language, first language models, trained AI will just be able to do prescriptive tasks. So, if you give it a bunch of images, it can learn what you're showing it, right? So it wouldn't necessarily be able to put things into context or draw its own conclusions. So in order to be able to put things into context and draw its own conclusions, the model sizes have increased exponentially. So maybe five years ago, in 2018, the model sizes would have been less than 100 million parameters. Today, these models that are trained and deployed are over over 500 billion parameters. So the amount of GPUs that are required for this is exponential.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, and what players in the space do you see benefiting from increased demand for AI related chips such as GPUs?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e So in video is gonna be a big beneficiary full disclosure, we all not only video stock, and we disclose all of our holdings on our website, but then you may be able to see the reason why Nvidia is such a beneficiary is because they came up with this CUDA architecture that is free for people to use. So if you want to build something on AI, all you need to do is buy the NVIDIA hardware, and then you can use these frameworks for free. Other companies are not there yet. So you could still buy GPUs from AMD. But then what do you do with them? But over time, as the industry develops, there is likely going to be other solutions, and maybe some of these other companies that are developing GPUs will benefit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area we really like that is not doing very well right now, is cloud infrastructure. So a lot of the cloud names are getting hit pretty hard, because of enterprise spending cuts. So this is a sector that hasn't really done that well in this recent bounce, this year. Nvidia is already up quite a bit here today, but the cloud cloud names have really not performed in line, so we like that. And then as you deploy AI, you're going to have a lot more vulnerabilities so you're going to need newer cybersecurity solutions. So this is another area where we find a lot of opportunities – basically how do you secure? How do you secure these AI workloads? And how do you secure eight edge computing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, so a lot of industries that are going to see some upside there and those segments, but the industry has struggled with keeping up with shift demand through supply chain constraints, severely dealing with shortages throughout the years of 2021 and 2022. If AI demand gears up in the near future, will semiconductor firms be able to manage their supply chains to keep up with demand trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we see a lot of supply actually getting added over the next two to three years. So we think there is going to be plenty of supply of chips available. And just to explain how this works, basically companies like Nvidia and AMD, they don't manufacture the chips, but they just design them and then foundries like TSMC will do the actual manufacturing. So we're seeing - this is a pretty big trend actually that's supporting even broader economic activity in the U.S. are these large CapEx investments by the foundries or the large chip manufacturers like TSMC. Intel as well has expansion plans. So there's going to be plenty of supply, we believe to meet the demand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat And just lastly, could you just break down the traditional segments of the semiconductor space? What spaces or segments do you see slowing down? And are there any other ones that you see an opportunity, and I know that you named a few, but if you just break them down for investors to understand a little bit more, I think that'd be fantastic. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. So basically the big separation is between consumer and data center. So, if you look at, for example, TSMC, revenues would be like half consumer, like a very high level, half consumer half data center. So consumer would be used in PCs, smartphones, and then on the data center side, this would be like cloud, cloud vendors, and in any sort of enterprise computing. And then within the data center segment, we're seeing slowdown across the board. So the consumer got pretty hard hit at the beginning of last year, PC demand has been significantly down but the way semis work is usually there is a lot of inventory in the system. So what the manufacturers or designers see is a lot worse than what in demand looks like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as inventory stabilizes, TSMC said that they're expecting it to stabilize at the beginning of this year, and to see pick up in the second half of next year. And then similarly, on the data center side, that segment just started seeing some weakness, but we believe that the high performance computing, which is what we talked about with Nvidia, like the chips that are required for AI, we expect those will hold up better.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat.

Thanks for joining.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you for having me!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, well, let's tee this up by talking about the fact that the concept of artificial intelligence, or AI, is something that has been getting a lot of attention, particularly recently with the breakout success of open AI, chat GPT, which is something we've talked about a lot here on Public Life. We can touch on that later in the discussion if you'd like. But before we dig into artificial intelligence in general, would you mind just giving listeners a little bit of background on Soundhound and what the business does?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I started three companies in undergrad and but after I graduated, I decided that I wanted to be a technical founder of a super high-tech company that would make a big impact in the world. So I went to Stanford University, and I got my Ph.D. in electrical engineering. And as I was looking for that, what would that next big change would be? I turned to science fiction, and in particular, Star Trek; I said, what do they have in stock? We don't have obvious answers like spaceships that go faster than light and teleportation and holodecks and replicators. But the one that was less obvious was voice AI. So the ability to talk to computers and robots and devices and rooms and have a natural conversation with them and ask them to do things and ask them to answer questions. And I thought that's something that would happen, for sure. And in my lifetime, and without conclusion, I started working from a dorm room at Stanford with my co-founders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Because science fiction does tend to become science fact over time. Right. That's, that's the old adage. So fast forward to today. Kayvon, you're out of your Stanford dorm. Talk to us about how the market for voice AI has evolved and what exactly SoundHound is doing. What does the product actually deliver?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eWe spent the first 10 years in stealth, so we kept to the secret. And we wanted to own the technology and make it better than anything else that was out there, and it took 10 years. But we finally achieved that milestone, and we unveiled it a few years ago. And today, we are one of the few companies that completely owns the full stack of voice AI and conversational AI in-house. So there are a lot of players. But most of those use a platform like ours. And we are one of the very few technology providers. And one of the unique attributes of SoundHound is that we aim really high. And we solve super complex problems that push the boundaries of what is possible. For example, what others are trying to do is they want to make computers catch up to humans in language understanding. But our goal is to make computers better than humans so they can do things that humans cannot do. And we are able to support really complex conversations. And that can make people more productive and make the world a better place. And I'll give you an example. Let's say you are looking for a restaurant and you had Chinese food yesterday. So you don't want Chinese food today. You still don't ask a personal assistant to show me restaurants except for Chinese because you don't think they will work. You kind of have learned the boundaries of where they fail and you just operate in that boundary. You ask them simple questions based on keywords. And if you do ask them to show me restaurants except for Chinese, they all say here are some Chinese restaurants where they actually give you the opposite of what you want. But without technology, you can say here's an example actually works. Today Show me Asian restaurants in San Francisco, excluding Chinese and Japanese, and only show the ones that have more than three stars and are open after 9 pm On Wednesday, and you get exactly what you want. Then you can follow up and refine it, and you have a conversation in a complex conversation. So most of our customers choose us because of our superior tech. But they also choose us because you're an independent provider of voice AI. So we don't hijack their brand, product, user, and data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eSo Keyvan, give us a really specific example of that, to bring this to life for the community. So you just gave the example where voice AI was effectively being used for search, right, that you are articulating, I want to find a restaurant with this cuisine in this area. In that example, who is your client? Is it the search engine is that the restaurant and into what device or into what platform is the user speaking to get that search result?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo we power devices and services. So with our cars, TVs, IoT devices, appliances, and those are the endpoints to interact with, you know, these domains. And then we also power services. So, for example, for restaurants. When was the last time you call the restaurant to place an order and you had a good experience, they usually don't pick up the phone. And when they pick up the phone, they are very distracted; it's noise in the background, and they are serving people walking in. And our solution addresses that problem. We take over their phone line; we always pick up the phone so you don't miss restaurants don't miss on any calls. And we give a really good experience for every user. We take their orders, we answer their questions, upsell people and give them recommendations. So we power products and services. And we have this ecosystem vision where we bring them together. So the services that we've voice-enabled now can be accessed by the users of products like you're driving your car, you can order food, you can book appointments, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berr: \u003c/strong\u003eGot it. I mentioned at the beginning that you do service smart devices; you've repeated them: TVs, autos, and restaurants came on to give us a sense of how big your addressable market is, how far you've penetrated it, and how much room there is left to run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThe voice AI category in the stock market is estimated to become 160 billion. And if you include search and monetization, you know that search is today keyword based. And Google makes a lot of money for keyword-based because people search with keywords advertisers bid on those keywords. If you include the concept that the next generation of searches conversational AI and comes from advertising, it will be much bigger than that. And there are very few providers because of the high barrier to entry. And today, we powered millions of products. The power of Vizio TVs, for example, they're the second-largest TV maker in the US. Just in the last few years, we have 17 car brands have chosen SoundHound, which is very impressive. And beyond TV and automotive, the power products like Snapchat, and Pandora, we work for companies like Netflix and MasterCard to become a robust IoT (Internet of Things) devices. We announced a strategic partnership with Qualcomm to integrate voice AI into their Snapdragon chipsets and the new Italian service fee analysis that sounds for restaurants that I just talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat overview. It's incredible to hear just how far SoundHoud has come from that 10 years and stealth to now having a public company out there and in full visibility. Let's talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within Voice AI. Can you talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within voice? Can you talk about whether you've seen the market for voice AI tech become a bit more crowded and how SoundHound has kept its edge and a competitive advantage?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I usually, so there are a lot of players in voice because Voice AI is happening, and people are adopting it, and there's a big demand for it. But there's a high barrier to entry. So the core technology providers in voice AI, I will say, a handful at a global scale. I usually say it takes 10 years to create voice AI technologies. And it takes three years to realize it will take 10 years, so I've seen several companies with resources start on the pack and then abandon it. So there's a really high barrier to entry, and as a platinum provider in multiple languages in multiple regions, multiple industries. Soundhound is very unique. So we support about 25 languages. We support multiple industries. We are in Asia; we are in Europe, we are in North America and South America, and we claim to be the best tech. And again a lot of customers are to choose us mainly for the quality of the tech. And the fact that you're independent and we don't hijack their brand and users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCould you talk a little bit cable and about how voice AI benefits consumers now and maybe in the future, and just what are some of the more surprising applications that, you know, the average person doesn't really know about yet? What are the hidden nuggets of the use cases that you've seen in your experience?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eI would answer that question by explaining our three-pillar business strategy because it's very innovative. You know, we've been innovating in the tech, but we also try to be innovative in the business. And the three-pillar business strategy is the answer to that. So let me explain what that is. So in the first pillar, we power devices and products like cars, TVs, and IoT devices. There will be 75 billion IoT devices projected by 2025. So the order of magnitude is larger than smartphones. And most of these devices don't have either the physical room or economical room to add, like a touchscreen or keyboard, or mouse. But the microphone is small and inexpensive. And that's all it takes to add voice to these products. So 75 billion devices, from cars, TVs, IoT devices, and appliances, can be voice-enabled. That's our pillar one. And the business model before that is very proven, you know, we get a royalty. And then we have edge and cloud. In the second pillar, we power services, like food ordering for restaurants and customer service, and think of restaurants as what books spread on Amazon. So Amazon started by selling books. They only did that a lot of people knew Amazon as an online bookstore. And when they did that really well, they did more things. And now they sell everything from A to Z. So for restaurants, there's a very complex problem. We have a lot of focus on that now. And then we'll expand to other areas. So that would be pillar two. So pillar one, and pillar two, are very, very proven business models; they don't depend on each other success of one doesn't depend on the success of the other one. And the third pillar is when we bring them together. So we bring the services that the voice-enabled to the products that be voice-enabled. And that creates a commerce ecosystem. So while you're driving your car, you can talk to your car to control the air conditioning and the radio and navigation, then you can also order food, conveniently and from restaurants that we are both enabled. And this ecosystem benefits everyone. Users, who are the most important part of the equation, are delighted because of the convenience and speed of ordering. Restaurants are happy because they get new leads from the ecosystem. And there's a lead revenue that they share with us. And then, we share that revenue with the product leaders with that car maker with the TV maker. And they benefit as well because, in many cases, they are able to generate incremental recurring revenue for the first time from the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eFascinating; it's been such an interesting part of the debate around AI lately, lots of conversation, talking about how the users of these new technologies are going to have to think perhaps much differently about privacy, or bias, or other ethical topics. When it comes specifically to voice AI and everything that you've seen. What are maybe some of the challenges through that ethical or privacy-focused lens that your space faces?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, yeah, so those are big challenges. And they're distinct challenges to privacy is one and bias another one. So we've seen, you know, videos and write the news when you know AI does says the wrong thing or unacceptable things undesired outcome, those happen, and the privacy's and other things like devices are always listening. So on the privacy side, that's one of the advantages that we deliver to our customers: we let them define their privacy policy and let them be as transparent as they want. And as restrictive as they want. In the way, they integrate both AI. And that's one of the disadvantages that, for example, if they get it from the big tech, they just inherit their privacy policy; whatever it is, they can't really control it. So we give flexibility to our customers. And one of the areas that can address privacy concerns is the recognition of the edge. So there's the cloud, and there's the edge so, so you're increasingly seeing both demand from our customers and our ability to run everything on the edge. So, for example, that user's voice doesn't need to leave the device, and then you can have devices that always listen without sharing your audio with third parties. On the bias. That's another challenge. And we are committed to being a pioneer in addressing those challenges. Our approach is that we combine machine learning models and software engineering algorithms to create our solutions. And the software sets the boundaries for the machine learning models. And then machine learning models are companions that make our solutions better within those boundaries that are set by our software engineers. So most of these undesired outcomes, and these are scenarios that you see in the news and other demos, are when machine learning models don't have boundaries, and then they learn from bad data, and then they have unpredictable behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eTo wrap everything together, Keyvan, what are some of the priorities that you and your team have in 2023 and beyond were the big growth opportunities that you guys are looking to lean into?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo the world has changed. And we are adapting and transforming to the change changes. We are transforming to be a much more financially efficient organization by reducing our costs while still growing our revenue at a very healthy rate. And our goal is to become profitable and cashflow positive within this year. We announced at the end of Q3 of the year, in quiet periods after only us will be publicly disclosed last time end of Q3 we had over $300 million of booking backlog. These are from committed customers. So we have a really solid foundation for our revenue growth with our reduced costs and increased focus. We believe we will increase our revenue growth this year, and we'll achieve our goal of becoming cash flow positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThese are big goals, and wishing you all the very best of luck as you pursue those.
