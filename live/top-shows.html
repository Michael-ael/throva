For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

Thank you so much for joining us. My name is Julia Rothacker. I'm the director of concierge here at Public. And we're thrilled to be with you today to talk a little bit about the reggae IPO of Shrek music royalties. Keith, would you like to introduce yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey Julia, for those who haven't met me yet? I am Keith Marshall GM of alternatives here at Public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerfect then let's dive straight in. Keith. I know this is a serious investment. But I'm also guessing everybody wants to hear about Shrek.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course. You know, as most of you should already know. Shrek is a bad tempered but good hearted ogre, who goes on a variety of quests in his fairy tale world. So Shrek is just a massive media franchise. It's the 17th highest-grossing film franchise of all time. And the second-highest-grossing animated film franchise which generated over $4 billion in box office sales just wild stats. And interestingly, there's actually a rumored fifth film possibly to be called Shrek Five. And you know as it's grown, the Shrek franchise has just really kept pace with streaming becoming evermore important in this media landscape. So the first two films launched on Netflix in March 2022. And were in the top 10 viewed when they were launched. Another wild stat customers watched 20.8 million Shrek and Shrek Two in the week they launched on Netflix. Those two movies have since shifted over to Peacock, which is obviously the affiliated owner of the Shrek franchise, but some are still visible on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat. And now let's shift a bit to what the investment offering is here. What exactly is a royalty?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, most people actually don't know what royalties are so short answer royalty interests are intellectual property. They're part of the copyright law. So really, the royalties are the actual payments. So the royalties are the payments that come to us from use of this content, the Shrek underlying content, and they're collected by what's known as performing rights organizations basically just like large clearing houses. These PRO's are what actually manage the rights on behalf of rights holders. So royalties are actual payments PRO's their job is to collect these payments from all these underlying sources of content distribution when the music from the Shrek franchise really you know the actual movies are used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks Keith and can you explain what exactly triggers a royalty payment for FRAC?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo this catalogue generates royalties from a bunch of different sources you know, use of the tracks in the movies when the movies are streamed or sold on theme park rides there's a holiday TV special called Shrek The Halls there are even Broadway plays about Shrek all of these different things lead to royalties being generated. And you know, that's it even makes money when the movie I Am Legend plays because Will Smith's character actually watches Shrek during I Am Legend. So a significant portion of these royalty earnings have come from international sources. So this asset actually benefits from not being tied solely to the US market as well. Relatedly there are a ton of references on Reddit videos on YouTube about people actually learning English from watching Shrek, that may be one of the reasons that international viewing is and has been so strong for Shrek. But you know, of course, broadcast and streaming represent the main portion of earnings just because you know the people watching Shrek so a question that's come up a few times from people that I want to clarify. This is the score, not the soundtrack. So Smash Mouth all-star is not included. But like Fairy Tale which some of you may know from recently going viral on TikTok is included. So this is the score just the underlying orchestral music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, I certainly have seen Fairy Tale a lot recently. So that gives a lot of clarity on how Our Shrek royalties work, and I am a big Shrek fan. So I love it. But this is also a an investment. Why would someone invest in royalties?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, as an attorney, we have to present a disclaimer, investors should always do their own research and understand all of these risks to consider before investing. But, you know, stepping back public's goal as a platform is to give investors tools that's investment products, and actually the education as well to build these modern diversified portfolios. And to answer your question, royalties can produce cash flow, which you know, in the current interest rate environment can definitely be appealing to investors. So in the case of the Shrek offering, any royalties received by the entity that holds these royalty interests will be paid out in the form of quarterly dividends. So royalties also benefit from being less correlated with other assets, you know, like Exchange Traded equities, because, again, they're driven by content consumption, not you know, for example, what the stock market is doing going up and down or doesn't, those things don't directly impact how people are watching Shrek and reduce correlation, cashflow. These can help investors lower portfolio volatility and hopefully increase returns on a risk-adjusted basis. So royalties are an investment tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks. And I understand that royalties are actually an established asset class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, so most people don't realize that this really is an investment product. And, you know, to date, institutional investors have just dominated the space is a direct example, the Michigan State employee pension funds have billions of dollars invested in music royalties, and catalogs can just sell for massive amounts, like the recent $225 million sale of Katy Perry's catalogue. You know, most people just can't participate in something like that. So with the Shrek royalties offering, investors can access royalties with as little as a $10 investment. And, you know, most of us don't have hundreds of millions to spend on a single asset, but Public wants to make these public markets actually work for all people. So this offering makes royalties more accessible to everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat makes sense. And why Shrek music within all music royalties,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou know, we talked about the Shrek franchise, and that's actually not the starting point for this thing. First and foremost, it's a mature asset. It has a 20-plus-year earnings history. And while we can't predict performance, you know, that means we're not relying on like how a single song by a single artist has done in the past year to assess what could happen in the next five years. It's also a strong recent historical performance, you know, earnings have actually grown in recent years due in part to streaming. We saw that last year with an earnings bump from Shrek on Netflix. And again, past performance is, of course, no guarantee of future results, but it makes our own analysis more meaningful. So comparing the 2022 calendar year earnings to the offering amount, the asset produced an eight-and-a-half percent return after fees. So it's also a life of rights interest, meaning this royalty interest is valid for the life of the composer Harry Gregson Williams plus seven years and Gregson Williams is 61 As of today. Lastly, it is Shrek we already discussed like it's an awesome media property and you know, Shrek Five could theoretically reinvigorate interest in the rest of the franchise, which could potentially increase royalty earnings. So again, Shrek Five does not yet have a release date. And recent strikes could of course, delay that, but we hope the movie is indeed forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, Keith, last question for you. How does the process work if someone wants to invest?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the offering is $889,700 in total $10 a share, but it can be oversubscribed. So we can actually take in requests for more than the 889k. As of today, the offering is reached about 77% of its total allocation. So it really just you go in the Public app or on our site and you can request shares at the Shrek asset page. After we receive these requests for at least the total offering amount the 889,700 we will process the closing and at that point, investors will be eligible for dividends after the closing. In addition to being eligible for these dividends, investors can participate in a secondary market, meaning they can buy and sell shares from one another on the Public platform. And I want to close out with a reminder that dividend payments aren't guaranteed. They depend directly on the consumption of Shrek to keep generating royalties.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant and today's show is brought to you by Gambling Group. Joining us today, we have a fantastic guest, David Rumsey, the journalist at Front Office Sports, and in this role covers the influence of sports on business and culture. He also co-authors a newsletter for Front Office Sports, and we have a ton to cover today because it has been a very wild summer in one specific aspect of the sports world that we're going to get into in a lot of depth and detail today that I'm personally really excited about. I've tried to follow this a little more than in recent years. We're going to talk about soccer and the influence of soccer on the U.S., on the sports entertainment business in the United States, how the United States' appetite for soccer is changing, and what that means for all of you investors out there listening. So, David, thank you so much for being here today. I really appreciate you joining us on Public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavid Rumsey: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks Kinsey, it's fun to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, for sure. So like I mentioned, you know, I think just to kind of kick things off, it's probably best to start with something that you and I are sure to agree on here, that in comparison, especially to the rest of the world, the United States is pretty famously not into soccer as a lot of the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, we maybe just don't appreciate it as much. Maybe we just have other bigger competitors like, you know, American football or basketball or any other sport. But I'd love to hear a little bit of your perspective on why you think the United States has been kind of slow to adopt soccer as, you know, one of our favorite pastimes to watch on TV, on streamers. Tell me a little bit more about how that appetite is changing and why it had to kind of change in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. We could have a whole other podcast discussion on the history of soccer in the world, in the U S and why baseball and football, and basketball might be more popular. But I think everybody, like you're saying, realizes soccer is maybe kind of the fourth or fifth most popular sport in the U S and it has been for some time. But to your point, it's growing and the women's world cup is going on right now. We had the men's world cup last year and when those big 10 pole events come up, America really gets behind their national soccer teams and MLS is growing. I know we're going to hit on Messi coming to the United States at Inter Miami. So there's an appetite there and even fans becoming more interested in European soccer, whether it's the Premier League, Champions League, Barcelona and LaLiga. Soccer players are global superstars, the men and the women. And I think that's really appealing to sports fans in the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think we, you know, we'll get into the Messi stuff for sure. But to the point that this, this is a sport that's largely dominated by the superstar kind of athletes, I think is something that's really interesting. I mean, obviously in the United States, in other sports, we've shown a ton of appetite for these superstar athletes, whether it's, you know, Derek Jeter or Tom Brady, or, you know, any of the famous U S women's gymnasts that we have loved to follow. I think that we can really relate to and resonate with that kind of superstar power when it comes to a sport. So with that in mind, knowing that we are talking a lot more about the stars on the US women's national team, about stars like Messi, do we think, do you think that we as the United States are going to at any point put soccer on the same kind of league that we would, or the same level that we would, like the NFL or the NBA, do you see that ever becoming a possibility just to set the stage before we get into some of the details of why we're talking about soccer more today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, that's certainly what MLS would like to see happen, right? They want to become not just a top league in the U S but they want to be seen as a top-five soccer league in the world. Keep in mind, there are so many other soccer leagues. Every country has a big domestic soccer league and you rank them across the world. So MLS is goal is to be seen on a global stage, um, you know, top tier up with Premier :eague, some of the top European leagues. So that's their long-term goal. And of course to do that, they're going to need to grow in the US. I think they've been seen as the fifth most popular sport behind, of course, football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. I think an argument could be made that they're gaining some ground. But if you look at their media deal right now with Apple, it's 10 years, $250 million a year. That's, that's a lot less than the billions and billions. The other leagues are bringing in, particularly the NFL and NBA. So on an annual basis, it's going to take some time, but of course you have the men's World Cup coming here in 2026 and everybody in soccer in the US is really banking on that event to play up the interest for fans and make money off of it every way that they can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. And it's, I think, an important point to note here, just the scale of what we're talking about here when 250 million is kind of small potatoes compared to some of these major, major deals. Like I really don't think that we can, you know, over-communicate the influence and the size and scale of some of these deals with streaming services, with broadcasters for the broadcasting rights to major sports in the United States. It's, it's a big business, I think, to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eBut to your point, a lot of this big business revolves around more tent pole events. Like you were talking about the Men's World Cup last year and in 2026. And this summer talking a lot about the Women's World Cup. I think that it's very difficult to have a conversation about how soccer is growing in terms of influence in the United States without talking about the women's national team. They have been certainly a record-breaking and attention-grabbing team for many years now, but this summer especially we're talking a ton about women playing soccer because of the Women's World Cup, because of people like Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe and all of these household names. Can you tell me a little bit more about how the women's national team has influenced soccer as a sport?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR:\u003c/strong\u003e For sure. I think they've really given America some juice on a global stage because frankly, when we look at our men's team, we're just not up there with the other countries in the world from Europe, from South America. When we get to the Men's World Cup, we'll maybe make it out of the group stage and then usually lose in the first round of the knockout stage. And the women's team is the complete opposite. You know, it's a given that we're going to make it out of each group stage, back-to-back World Cup champions on the women's side. So I think that shows the U.S. can be a powerhouse, right? Because we're giving all these resources to our women's team. And that's a whole nother issue that maybe other countries aren't devoting as many funds to their women's teams as their men's teams. But we are here in the U.S. and that's given us four World Cup titles on the women's side and been a real leader in the space. And I think you see the fans get behind it. I mean, the viewership is there. The second group stage game in this Women's World Cup set a record viewership on Fox for the group stage in a Women's World Cup. So the interest is there, the players are there, but the world is catching up a little bit in terms of funding their women's teams more. And this World Cup, I think, is showing some fierce competition. So it's not gonna be a cakewalk for the women's team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo let's talk about how these teams are funded. Obviously here in the United States, what the women's national team gets paid has been a major topic of conversation for even casual sports fans. If I, as somebody who doesn't know a ton about soccer, know about this fight for better pay that the women's team has been fighting for a long time now, I think it's safe to say a lot of people who are just casual sports fans also know about it. So... let's talk about kind of where that money is coming from. What is the business kind of state of play in soccer in the United States right now? Can you give me kind of a lay of the land of how the money's made, where the money is spent, sort of what's going on in terms of soccer in the U.S. as a business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR:\u003c/strong\u003e From a very 30,000-foot view, you have US Soccer, which is the governing body of soccer here in the United States of America. And they manage the Men's National Team, the Women's National Team, all the other junior teams, under-21 teams, all the way down into youth participation in soccer on a kids' level. So their job is a lot more than building a World Cup champion on the men's or women's side. Yes, that's part of it. And we want to compete on a global stage, but US Soccer. brings in all this money to fund soccer participation around the country, right? So they want as many kids playing soccer right now when they're six, seven years old. And two decades from now, maybe they'll be the next Megan Rapinoe, right? Or Christian Pulisic. So they get a lot of money from media rights. FIFA sells rights to the World Cup, and that brings in billions and billions of dollars. It can get a little complicated in the most recent deals on the US side. Fox was able to buy the World Cup rights for the men's and the women's through 2026. And we know that FIFA has had some corruption scandals in the past, and it's not necessarily a clean business there. But they bring in those media rights and then they distribute it back to the governing bodies around the world, U.S. Soccer being one of them. And then they allocate how they see fit based on the performance. And that's why. the women's national team has been fighting for equal pay there on that side. They're saying, you know, hey, we're winning World Cups. The men aren't performing. Why aren't we getting, you know, the same amount if not more? So that's a big argument, obviously, but that's media is a big reason these teams and the U.S. soccer gets paid money. So that's where a lot of the funding comes from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and you know, it's hard to have a conversation around media and soccer without talking about Lionel Messi. Obviously, this has been just an enormous story in the soccer world, also in the business world, talking about how he negotiated this deal, how his team brokered this deal to come play in America. I know you've covered it extensively. Can you tell me a little bit about Messi's influence, broadly speaking, on soccer as a game, but also soccer as a business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. Well, I just know personally, I've had friends who became fans of soccer because of Messi, watching him play for Argentina on a global stage, watching him play at his Barcelona days in European soccer. And back when I wasn't as much of a fan of soccer, Messi was still one of those names that I knew. Ronaldo was a name that everybody knew, even if you weren't a soccer fan. They were some of the most popular athletes in the world alongside LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Tom Brady, and Peyton Manning here in the US at least. Messi is just he's global and he's still you know, he might not be at the peak of his elite powers now, but he still won the World Cup last year and was the most valuable player there last summer and he came to Inter Miami and it's stoking just huge amounts of excitement among American fans and bringing more attention globally to the MLS.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd tell me a little bit about what this deal is that Messi struck with Inter Miami. What are some of the bigger contours of the deal that make it something that's striking enough to kind of gain national attention?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, MLS is different than a league like the NFL or NBA that has a hard salary cap and you can only pay players a certain amount and you have to spread it out over equally over the players pretty much. In MLS, you can have designated players where their salaries don't count towards the salary cap because there are financial structures in place to limit the spending of these teams because... Frankly, they don't have as much money to spend. As we talked about, only $250 million of media rights coming in per year compared with 10 billion for the NFL. There's not as much money to go around, but I bring that up because when you have a player like Messi, he comes in, he's bigger than the team. Everybody would say that. So he can be a designated player and get paid in different ways. So Inter Miami knows that. they're going to get a lot, a lot of revenue from Messi coming in, whether it's Jersey sales, ticket sales. Messi actually brokered a deal with Apple reportedly to receive some equity of season ticket, uh, um, signups to the MLS season pass subscription service because Apple said, you know what? We know people are going to pay more and be more interested in our service. If Messi is here. So they were willing to give him a cut of their proceeds basically to help him lure him to MLS. So it's a very interesting deal between his salary, between an ownership stake potentially with his club, Inter Miami after his playing days, some incentives from Apple, some reported incentives from Adidas on the Jersey supply side. So he could be making well north of a hundred million dollars a year. And, you know, a typical MLS player is lucky to be breaking, you know, a few million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's really incredible to, again, recognize just the scale of some of these deals and the scope of some of them. Certainly something interesting as, again, a casual sports fan, but also somebody who loves to understand more about these incentive structures in the business world and especially in media. This is just a really interesting story to watch unfold. So I'm excited to kind of continue to keep an eye on it. And with that, as we close out our conversation here, David, I would love to hear a little bit of your perspective on just big-picture thinking and things that you're expecting, expectations from soccer in the next couple of years, knowing that we do have some of these big stories on the horizon, like we talked about today with Messi, with the US Women's National Team. What are you expecting from soccer as a sport and soccer as a business in the coming years? Tell me a little bit more about your expectations for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think right now, this summer, I'm interested to see if the U.S. Women's National Team can get a third straight World Cup title and what they would be able to do from a marketing perspective and investment perspective of saying we're really the dominant force in global soccer on the women's side to keep propelling their fight for equal pay and pushing those stars that you have the National Women's Soccer League in the U.S. So certainly that's going to keep. a World Cup victory would keep propelling that, you know, our domestic league here in the US. But beyond that, you know, I think it's coming up in 2026 is the Men's World Cup is going to be in North America. So primarily in the US, but also in Canada and Mexico, it's a joint bid. All three of those countries are going to be hosting the World Cup. And it's just going to be huge. In 1994, the US hosted the World Cup. And that's kind of what kicked off Major League Soccer in the US. And that was kind of FIFA wanted to wake up the American fan base and it's worked. It's a slow burn. Obviously, we've been talking about how MLS is not quite on the level of NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL. But everybody in soccer is just so bullish on the men's World Cup coming here in 2026. And then, by the way, the US is bidding to host the women's World Cup the year after that in 2027. So it's just going to be. so much opportunity if they were to get that on the heels of the men's World Cup. There's nothing like a kid being able to go to a World Cup game. Yes, it's fun to go to an MLS game or a Premier League friendly that might be playing at a football stadium during the summer. But being able to see the World Cup and just kind of the stature of that, that's going to stoke so much excitement. And it's a long-term play, obviously. You know, if you're a kid, 10 years old, you become a fan of soccer. It's You're not going to make an impact if you become a player for, you know, at least a decade. But that's what everyone is bullish on. And, of course, the commercial financial opportunities. Fox is going to be broadcasting that World Cup, but all these NFL stadiums will be hosting games. It's not decided yet where the World Cup final will be taking place. Of course, New York wants to host it. Los Angeles wants to host it, maybe even Dallas. So there's everybody wants a piece of the pie, and they want to capitalize on that. So any time. You see a new venue being built. You see somebody investing in a soccer team. They're always citing the World Cup in 2026. That's the inflection point. And then beyond that, it's going to be up to the soccer stakeholders in the U S to capitalize on that and bring in the most interest in the sport as they can beyond that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. All right. Well, David, what a way to end this conversation, I think, to look ahead to understand where we might go next is always super interesting. I'm eager to watch how, you know, 2026 and 2027 potentially play out. I think this could be another interesting conversation to keep track of as a sports fan, and as an investor. So, David Rumsey, thank you so much for joining us today on Public. I appreciate your time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, thanks for having me on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course.

I'm your host, Kinsey Grant and I am so excited to be here with you today. This episode is going to be super informative. We have a stellar guest here to talk about online gambling and sports betting and earnings headed right your way right now, Charles Gillespie is Chief Executive Officer, Co-founder and a Director at Gambling.com Group. That's the ticker G-A-M-B. Gambling.com Group is a leading provider of digital marketing services for the global online gambling industry and was founded in 2006. Charles. Welcome to Public, how's it going?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharles Gillespie: \u003c/strong\u003eThings are going very well. Thanks for having me on, look forward to sharing our great story with your audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm excited to hear this story and I think that framing it as a story is really the way to start here. So let's hear a little bit about the beginning of the story. If you will, I want to hear more about your company. Do you mind giving me just a brief overview of your business model?Tell me a little bit about how your business works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure, no problem. So, what we do for the online gambling industry is basically the same thing that, say Hotels.com does for hotels. So if you wanna go to Paris, you're not gonna go to 10 different Parisian hotel websites to find a hotel or you're gonna go to hotels dot com or booking dot com or something like that and get all the information in one place and make a decision there. So, we basically do the same thing for the online gambling industry. So if you're gonna bet on sports and you're in, let's say Massachusetts, (just because Massachusetts just launched sports betting) there are a great many different places you could play at, online in Massachusetts, which are now legal and regulated. And, it, you know, our typical users that go to Google, they search for something like top Massachusetts sports books, they'll find one or more of our websites: we've got betmassachusetts.com, we've also got gambling.com, bookies.com and a lot of other sites, they'll find one of our sites, they'll find the information they're looking for. So, you know, top 10 sports books in, in Massachusetts and then they'll click and leave one of our websites, go to one of those sports books, register deposit play. And then we get paid, and, and what we do is called performance marketing because we only get paid when the traffic we send to these, online gambling companies performs when they actually sign up deposit in play. And if they don't, we don't get paid anything. And that's the the nature of the performance marketing model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo tell me a little bit about, you know, the, the bigger picture that's going on here and we'll get into earnings in a second. But I imagine it's been quite a, a transformative time and, you know, momentous several years for, for your business and for working in the space in which you work with the advent of, of legal gambling and legal, online gambling and sports betting in all, all sorts of different states. Tell me a little bit more about how you view that momentum's impact on your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it really has been a, a hell of a couple of years, but we started this all the way back in 2006. Myself and, and the COO we both went to UNC, we're both from North Carolina. And, we wanted to start a legal and proper business in the online gambling industry, even all the way back in 2006. And back then, there was no legal online gambling in the United States. So we left, and we ended up building this business in Europe. Our largest office has been in Ireland for a number of years. Our largest market has been the UK, for most of the history of the company. And, then in 2018, when the Supreme Court unblocked sports betting, across the US, we had to turn the ship around and point it back at the US and, and really kind of come full circle. So, we've seen this industry grow and grow and grow and we understand how early it still is in the US and kind of North American regulated online gambling market. You know, a lot of people look at New Jersey, which has had, online casino gaming for nearly 10 years. And sports betting for, you know, five years and they think that it's, it's done or it's mature or that, you know, everyone's already signed up for all the, all the online sports books already and there's kind of, you know, it's not gonna grow and, and we know that that's not the case. You know, we've seen big markets like the UK Ireland, even Sweden, Italy, you know, just grow and grow and grow, you know, 20 years after, they first regulated. So we see an incredible situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYou've got this, this industry which is high margin, high growth and booming all around the world, which basically did not exist in the United States for regulatory reasons. And then the doors have just been kind of flung open in 2018. And now you've got a majority of states with regulated sports betting. You got a handful of states with online casino and more are gonna come every single year. so you, you've taken, you're going from this situation where regulated online gambling in the United States was sub a billion. And, I don't even know what the latest figures are because it changes so quickly. But, you know, it's, I don't know, it's, you know, estimates are 40 or 50 billion in, in, you know, another five or 10 years, which is crazy. I mean, it, you can, it's impossible to think of another, industry where you've gone from sub a billion to 50 billion in the space of, you know, 10 or 15 years. So it, it really is an incredibly exciting industry. We do love this industry and, we're very happy to, to be bringing this business back to the United States. And of course, we did the IP O in 2021 which was, you know, we got the picture on the, on the wall behind me here. That's, that was clearly one of the big, one of the big days in our history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I, I can imagine there is a, a ton of excitement and it seems to be a theme, you know, with all this momentum in mind, I want to talk about earnings. You reported earnings late last week, tell me what are three things you would want investors to take away from your most recent earnings report.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eKind of three big lessons. So uniquely within the online gambling industry or at least within the publicly traded companies in the United States that focus on this sector. You know, basically, all of them are high growth but, but very few of them are profitable and very few of them are very profitable and we are both high growth and highly profitable. So, year-on-year growth in the quarter was 36%. Virtually all of that was organic growth. There was a tiny contribution from one month of an acquisition. But, you know, then we also had adjusted margin at 40% and free cash flow of over six million, you know, so we actually make money, you know, in, in, in kind of sharp contrast to a number of the more high profile names in the sector. Which obviously gets a lot of attention. And, and because of that, I think it's, it's, really a unique business. But, the thing I'd, I'd also call out is, look, we grew 33% year on year in North America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd that's against Q one last year, which had the monumental launch of sports betting in New York State, which, you know, I'm sure there's more than a few people listening to this from New York you know, the finance community there is, is great and very into sports betting and it was kind of all the rage in, in Q one last year and, and obviously that drove great results for us a year ago. And despite that kind of blowout number, those blowout numbers in North America a year ago, we still grew 33% year on year in North America, this Q one. But on the other side of the Atlantic and our other kind of main segment in the UK and Ireland, we actually grew 36% year on year, which is even faster than North America, which, again gets back to this idea that this industry keeps growing for a very long time, you know, they regulated online gambling in, in the UK in about 2005. And it, you know, and it, the industry is still growing the affiliates, you know, companies like us performance marketing companies, they're continuing to occupy a kind of bigger and bigger part of the player acquisition within the whole sector. And companies like ours are continuing to take market share within the affiliate performance marketing space. So, you know, to me it's, it's, it's really surprising that we grew even faster in the UK and Ireland, than North America. But, you know, they're both high growth and, and that's perfectly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think that this, this hint at this larger idea that, you know, you, you started this conversation with the story of your company, the story of this industry. I'm curious about whether this last quarter one that you, you know, just reported earnings for, does this impact the bigger picture story for your company at all? Does this change anything for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eI think Q one was, it was like it was a record quarter. But, you know, as a high-growth company, most quarters are supposed to be record quarters. So I think, you know, there wasn't any strategy shift or any sort of, I, I think, I think what was a remark about the quarter was just, it's, the fantastic numbers with us just focusing on the business. You know, there was no acquisitions, there was no, nothing out unexpected, nothing out of the ordinary and, and, and we still drove as strong of a performance as we did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, totally. So, with all of that in mind, I wanna understand a little bit more about the future and hear your perspective on the future. So we'll take a second here to kind of pivot to look ahead. Tell me a little bit about the rest of this year. What are your priorities look like as a company through the rest of 2023?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eGenerally speaking in North America, we focus on, a couple of things. So new state launches are very important for us and we had a number of new state launches last year. This year, they're, we're not expecting to have any new states launch before the end of the year. And that's, you know, that's a very helpful tailwind. But despite that, you know, we've put out very, healthy guidance at the beginning of the year and we've already raised that guidance on the back of the Q one report that we had put out, last week. So, you know, even without new state launches, we're targeting revenue of, 90 where let me make sure I give you the exact, the right numbers here, the, the, the 95 to 99 million, you know, so, knocking on the door of 100 million this year.  And, if we do get any new state launches, you know, because Kentucky is regulated, you know, North Carolina, is probably going to regulate, you know, do the legislation in the next kind of 23 weeks. We're very positive on North Carolina, it's an important state for us. And when those states after they legislate, then they actually need to publish a timeline to launch. And once we have clarity on that, we will add it to the guidance because there's nothing in the guidance now about new state launches. So when we know North Carolina is going live, when we know Kentucky is going live, then we'll, we'll be able to, to tell the market and, and adjust. But the other thing I really, have people think about, and what we are really focused on for the remainder of this year is our new media partnership with Gannet. So Gannet is the largest publisher of daily newspapers in the United States. They publish USA Today, you know, which is the only kind of truly non-business national newspaper in the United States, with a very good sports section. And we have partnered with Gannet to help them monetize sports betting. They know that they've got a huge opportunity with all these different digital media properties of theirs and this great big audience and they came to us to help them, maximize the opportunity and, and, and basically make money off of this industry. If you look at it from our perspective, you know, when we try to grow the business, we can, we can add content to the websites. We already have, we can build new websites, we can buy websites or we can partner with websites and, and that's what we've done with t so, now if you go to USA Today.com/betting, you'll see our content. So that's all us. We've built, you know, essentially this kind of mini site of sports betting information and, and we, you know, pipe that into USAtoday.com and that should be a pretty meaningful driver of revenue, into the end of the year, especially after the start of NFL. So, as you can imagine, the start of the NFL season is really the kind of coming out party, for, for sports betting, every year. You know, it's a, it's a time of the year when, people set up a lot of new accounts, people obviously bet on the NFL more than they bet on anything else. And, you know, being in position at the beginning of the autumn sports season is very important for all sports betting companies, including ourselves. So, we expect to be in a good place in September for that autumn season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, very interesting. And we'll, we'll have to check back in, in September too and I've got one last question for you here, Charles; you've talked a bit here about, you know, the, the bigger story, the broader industry trends and contours that are, are driving gambling as an industry right now, sports betting as an industry right now, I'm curious to hear your perspective on when, if at all, there is a tipping point, you know, you mentioned that the growth you're, you're seeing in Europe, in the UK and Ireland is still significant and still in some ways surprisingly significant, right? But I'm curious about if, you know, there's a point at which that growth might begin to slow down for the industry writ large. Tell me a little bit more about what that might look like if you think that might even come to fruition at all. What do you think the longer-term picture for the industry looks like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I think, I think the growth, you know, by definition has to slow, but, you know, the question is really by how much, you know, and, and you know, how, how many years do we have left while it's still high growth? I.e.; more than kind of 30 plus percent a year. And I would think we've got probably, you know, at least a decade plus, possibly more. You know, not every state has regulated sports betting. Very few states have regulated online casino. And frankly, you know, it's just like a land-based, casino. You know, if you look at the size of the slots and you look at the size of the sports book, there'll be about, you know, 10 times as much space given to the slots. And that's because that's where the money is at. Sports betting is actually kind of a low-margin business. And, and in many, you know, a lot of people in the industry look at it as kind of, a player acquisition tool. It's a way to get someone through the door and then hopefully they stop and play some blackjack or, you know, some slots, which is a, a product in the casino which is a higher margin product. So I think, you know, you've got an enormous amount of regulatory progress left to be made, which, which I think will be made. online casino is a little bit of a tougher sell for some of these legislatures as you can imagine, but it wasn't so long ago that sports betting was inconceivable in, in so many of these states. So, you know, the, there's a kind of 50 plus 60 70 years plus, timeline of, increasingly regulating gambling in the United States and, and online is just kind of the latest, manifestation of that. So, we don't think there's any lack of, of momentum in, in the regulatory, from the regulatory standpoint. And as we, you know, get through the next couple of years, you'll get a couple of online casino states a couple more. And that will really seriously move the needle in addition to some more sports betting states, but even the existing states will grow. You know, there's, there's this kind of surge of interest when the state launches because you have all this pent-up demand which comes to market, and then things settle down. and, but once they settle down, then they grow consistently, you know, for, for, you know, probably 10 plus years. And that gives, you know, you look at the New Jersey numbers, they've had, you know, they've been doing this kind of longer than anyone and the numbers are, are fantastic and still growing. So, you know, it's, it's, and, and to very briefly touch on, you know, all things not North America, you know, this is a global industry, there's a lot of money being made around the world in this industry and it's not just English speaking markets, like, you know, the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, you know, you've got Japan, which is probably gonna come online in the next, you know, a couple of years in a, in a legal way. You've got Brazil, which is regulating, you know, there's, there's a lot of, you know, practically every market in Europe is, is still growing, and, and, you know, profitable and, and, and very nice business for the online gambling operators. You know, our clients, as well as the online gambling affiliates, you know, performance marketing companies like ourselves. So, you know, everybody seems to focus on the US because, you know, we're listed in the US. Our investors are mainly in the US. Of course, it's kind of front of mind for them. But the amount of opportunity outside the US is, is easily as compelling as, as the US opportunity itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, certainly very interesting to keep in mind and I appreciate the big picture thinking and the broad context here, Charles, this has been such a, a wonderful conversation.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI really appreciate you taking the time sharing more about the story of your company and your recent earnings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, it's been wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo thank you so much for coming by.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eMy pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course and wanna once again, want to thank our guest Charles Gillespie, Chief Executive Officer, Co-founder, and a Director at Gambling.com Group.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant. Today's show is brought to you by SinglePoint, a renewable energy and sustainable lifestyle company. And I'm so excited to welcome our guests, which I will do in just a minute, to give you a quick heads up on what we're gonna be talking about today. We have some major big time investing themes coming at you in today's edition of the Public Podcast. We're talking solar as a category within the renewable sector, which is obviously very interesting to, I'm sure, tons of you who are listening to this right now. We're gonna be talking about what solar means for the broader renewable sector, about some of the companies that make up the solar value chain. We're gonna be talking about the Inflation Reduction Act. And of course, throughout all of this, the ways that you as investors can potentially add this theme to your portfolio and hopefully learn a lot. So to do all of that, I'm super excited to welcome our wonderful guest today. Rene Reyna, the Head of Thematic ETF Product Strategy at Invesco. Rene, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e Hi Kinsey, great to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, super excited to jump in today. We have, like I mentioned, a lot to cover. So if you're ready, we'll get right into it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eWorks for me. I'm excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, me too, me too. Okay, so Rene, I wanna start here with kind of the big picture. We are definitely going to get into the Inflation Reduction Act stuff, which has obviously been a huge moment for renewables as a sector. We'll get to that during this conversation, but before we get there, I would love to talk about solar as it fits into renewables as a broader sector in investing in the economy. Tell me a little bit about how solar is tracking within the renewable sector right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure. So, you know, if it's okay, maybe just take a step back and, you know, just think of renewables or clean energy in the sense of this energy transition that's taking place. And so, you know, I think we all recognize what are the drivers there. So one, you got climate change. You know, the science does demonstrate that the burning of fossil fuel does have a major impact to the air we breathe, right? And so there's the negative impacts associated with the environment. There's negative impacts associated with human health. And then there's the economic impacts that are also a result of some of this climate change. So I think of clean energy, renewable sort of along the sustainability sort of opportunity set, if you will. I think secondly, there's energy security we need to think about. So, you know, the less reliance we have on energy imports, you know, think of the power OPEC has and how that impacts the average consumer, you know, I think renewables can help solve for that. And then there's economic benefits. I mean, if we think about job creation as a result of some of these new transitions that are taking place, the new technology, if you will, and then also the lower energy costs as we create more scale along some of the renewable sources. So it really is exciting what's taking place, renewables. If I look at solar specifically, you know, it's just one important part of the sort of renewable puzzle. And so I think of solar in the context of what are the other renewable energy sources. So, generally speaking, you think about wind, you think about hydro, you think about biomass, and geothermal, and collectively renewables are surpassing US electric generation. For example, we passed nuclear in 2021, we passed coal-fired generation in 2022. So renewables are really having a meaningful impact. The US renewables represent 21, 22% of US electricity generation. Solar is about 3.5% of that, which goes to the question. So solar, as a part of this renewable puzzle, if you will, it is a, it's unique and it's very important. It's widely available, easy to deploy. So we think about the sun as a resource. Clearly, it's a resource that we have available day in and day out. It could be easily installed, so it's flexible. So think about installing rooftops, large solar farms, as an example. I think what's unique about solar, from an investment perspective, is cost. And so if we think about from 2010 to about 2020, we've seen costs of solar installs come down. Now, it hasn't been just a straight line downward. We've seen some pressures and increase in costs the last couple of years. But that in itself, if you think about some of the trade-offs, we go back to early 2000s, a lot of consumers, for example, were not doing the math and saying, hey, what is the breakeven if I want to install a solar panel in my home? And generally, it was about 20 years. And then you fast forward to today, and that breakeven. In a single digit of years. And again, there's a lot of other factors that can go into that. But clearly there's been a lot of advancements. So I think that makes soil unique. The economic benefits and job creation, which I mentioned earlier, if we think about solar jobs in comparison to oil extraction, coal mining, there's actually more US jobs in solar production than there are in those two categories, which I don't think many people realize. So there is this economic benefit. And sort of the last component I think about solar, and I know this is a long answer, so I apologize, but the innovation, the technology around solar. If I think of the solar plus storage, for example, Renova, which is one of the holdings in one of our ETFs, partners with Tesla's Powerwall for installs. The solar battery storage went from saving approximately six minutes worth of energy up to about 10 hours plus today. And so those are some of the factors that I think make solar exciting if I think about renewable energy more broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a phenomenal way to get started with this conversation. I think that established a ton of the important context that we need to understand why solar and renewables, more broadly speaking, have become a theme that investors might be gravitating toward. And later in the conversation, I do want to make sure we hit on that element of how investors might be able to add solar as a theme to their investing portfolio and to their investing strategy. But even before we get there. I would love to dig in a little bit more to the nitty gritty of the renewable sector, particularly solar. When we're talking about the energy value chain, the solar energy value chain, I'm curious about what has made it such that those prices have come down. We're talking obviously about a lot of different moving parts and elements that come together to create solar as a part of the renewable sector. But I'm curious to hear a little bit more about the industries or the sub-industries that might be contributing to this wider proliferation of solar energy as part of the renewables landscape. What are those elements that are coming together to make solar a more affordable or more accessible option right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so I think in the general sense, or in these terms, is increased utilization, increased technology. And that scalability has helped bring down costs if I think of the solar value chain Specifically, so you know generally the components are you have sort of the production side insulation side you have financing then you have kind of ongoing maintenance and When you think of it from you know, just breaking down some of these segments. So the first component is upstream, so think polysilicon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, DocuNew Energy and GCL Technologies, who are the largest players in this space, those polysilicon costs have come down quite a bit. And these materials are used for kind of that midstream area where we think about solar panel manufacturers. So, you know, solar panels are made up of PV cells. They convert sunlight into electricity. So you have solar wafers, solar cells, and solar modules. The companies that played this there would be like Cinco Solar Canadian solar United renewables These are sort of your midstream players. This also includes inverter Manufacture so you have to at some point convert your son into your DC to AC back to DC and so these inverters are Inverse using manufacturers. So think of like the end phases of the world solar edge. These would be considered kind of that midstream category. And then from there, you kind of go downstream. So now start thinking about installers, distributors, some of the utility companies. And Cavus is a big solar utility company. No far energy, if I think about like installations and building out of some of these solar farms, they're a big company in this space. So globally, this sets up sort of this value chain. And so as more commitments to increasing solar utilization, increasing capacity, that has over time driven down cost. When we look at sort of the space and say, well, who are some of the bigger suppliers that are helping, you know, reduce some of these costs? You know, China is the biggest manufacturer when it comes to solar manufacturing, solar parts. And so it's really some of their scale. We looked at China economically a lot for lower manufacturing costs. But collectively, that has brought down some of the costs. And so demand is growing not only in China, it's growing in Europe, it's growing in the US. So all these countries and corporations, for that matter, who are making commitments to reduce their carbon emissions, is all contributing to the scale and that's ultimately bringing down some of those costs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, it certainly makes a lot of sense. And I think this idea of the way that renewables are scaling and solar specifically are scaling right now certainly makes a compelling case for why this cost might be decreasing. This utilization has really picked up and we have reason to believe that it might continue to pick up because of news that has come from DC, from certain industry, but very much DC over the last year or so. I think this is a great segue to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed last year, made some pretty landmark provisions for clean energy. I would love to hear your perspective on how the Inflation Reduction Act, commonly referred to as the IRA, how that might've impacted solar. Tell me a little bit more about what the impact has been from that legislation on the solar space. So, I'm gonna go ahead and start with the solar. So, I'm gonna start with the solar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it was huge, in my opinion. You know, I think it just speaks to our commitment, which globally, I think there was some concern. So, you know, not to get into the politics of it, but, you know, it's kind of goes to the timeline. You know, there was a transition from President Trump to President Biden. You know, almost immediately he rejoins the Paris Accord. And so this is sort of the global commitment to reduce, you know, carbon emissions. And then he also had his legislation that ultimately got passed, the Inflation Reduction Act, and it resulted in the largest climate-related bill ever. So $369 billion in spending and green energy tax credits were a result of the IRA. And so in some cases, it extended some tax credits that are already exist. Some listeners maybe heard of the Energy Policy Act that was created back in 2005. And so there were already some subsidies or tax credits that were in place that were sort of being reduced over time. And so this sort of reignited those tax credits, extended them for another 10 years, increased some of those tax credits up to 30%. And so this really helps stimulate this marketplace. And so if I think some of the impact of the IRA specifically, you heard me talk a lot about reducing carbon emissions. So I think this sort of fast tracks the US a little bit. There are various studies out there. I think some of what I read was perhaps it increases our speed by 40 percent in terms of hitting some of these targets by 2030. So I think that was impactful. I think also there were parts of the IRA that included tax credits for production. So there's been a lot of talk, I think we've heard in the news, around on-shoring, so reducing our reliance on other countries and their production. So there was a lot of supply chain issues, for example, that delayed and increased costs recently. And so these new incentives should and actually are enticing companies to produce and manufacture here in the US. So again, I talked about some of the economic benefits around job creation. So that's a positive. And we've seen some of the largest manufacturers. So First Solar, A Solar, you know, they've all committed already to manufacture here in the US. So, you know, this should serve as a stimulus really to this transition. Now again, I think we have to acknowledge the environment we're in today. You know, we have a high inflation and interest rate environment. So we are seeing a little bit of maybe not the quick acceleration that we would like. And I think a lot of it is because now you have consumers, businesses have to make decisions around investments due to the inflation and trade environment. But nonetheless, over the long term, this is viewed as net positive. And I think the one thing I'll say too, and I hope, I just want to emphasize that, because the costs have come down so significantly, because corporations and countries are committing to reducing their carbon emissions, I look at some of these subsidies and incentives as really icing on the cake. And so in other words, I think we were kind of going down this path already, and now you have some, let's call it longer commitments in terms of the US with these tax credits that should help maybe move some of those that were on the fence a little bit about making that commitment, sort of bring them over the line, if you will. So I think it's really exciting and we should see increased solar production as well as solar utilization here in the US over the next few years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a great kind of big picture, 30,000 foot view of what's going on in solar. And it's certainly helpful to hear the context in the background around how this very much talked about legislation is actually going to come to fruition with the economic realities that we're all facing today. So now that we have gotten that big picture, that kind of zoom out view of what's going on in solar, I would love to talk a little bit about the more micro, how can investors who are listening to this, include solar in their portfolios as a theme, knowing what we know now about the impacts of the global value chain of the Inflation Reduction Act, of all of these big picture ideas we've talked about. How can investors approach potentially adding solar into their strategy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I guess there's a lot of couple of ways, right? So hopefully you've heard over my comments. I talked about some of the value chain, if you will. So certainly there's ways to sort of handpick companies, if you're an integral stock buyer, to try and pick and choose those that you think could participate in this theme. I think there's some maybe more efficient ways. The ETF market allows you really to capture a theme. We here at Invesco actually have the industry's first and largest solar ETF. The ticker on that is $TAN. And really the approach of this fund, so it's a passive strategy, it's rules-based. We basically are tracking the max solar index. And what this index is comprised of is all the companies that sort of represent the solar value chain. And so what the methodology or the index does is it screens for companies that either will be considered a pure play, so two-thirds or more of their revenue is coming from the solar theme, and those would get sort of like a 1.0-factor weighting, if you will. And then companies that we consider medium plays. These are companies that have at least a third. And up to two-thirds of the revenue coming from the Solar theme. They'll get sort of a half of their weighting. And this then index sort of creates a list of companies. Currently, there are 44. It's a modified market cap. So it'll set limits on how much a company can represent in the portfolio. So the limit today is 10%. And then what happens is every quarter that those rules are reapplied and rebalanced on a quarterly basis. So you're ensuring you're maintaining ownership of these pure plays. I think an interesting thing as well as about this ETF, the solar landscape is global. So I mentioned China is a leader. We're seeing growth in Europe. And so you are going to have global representation in this US, which is important if you really want to capture the theme. So today, it's about 35% US exposure, 15% is coming from China, 12% is real. Then you have some smaller ones. You have some Germany holdings, Hong Kong. So it really gives you sort of that broad exposure to the theme. And it's just a convenient way in one ticker to get exposure. The fund is currently about two billion in size. So I mentioned it's one of the largest and it's got a cool ticker too, I mean, T-A-N, tan, easy to remember, think of the sun. And so it's been an easy way for investors to get pure-play exposure to this theme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly tan during the summertime. How could you forget it? So simple. All right, so Renee, this has been such a wonderful conversation. I really appreciate all of your incredible context and analysis, and insight. Feel like I've really learned a ton about this space right now. That has certainly gotten a lot of interest over the last several months and years. So thank you so much for coming on the public podcast and for sharing all of this with us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eExactly. Absolutely great to be here, and again appreciate the opportunity to be on your podcast Kinsey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you so much. And with that, I want to thank one more time our guest, Renee Reyna, head of thematic ETF product strategy at Invesco, for his time today.

I'm your host Kori Hale and of course, I'm always happy to be with you all, especially this afternoon. We're going to be breaking down what's going on in the regulatory environment as it relates to decentralized finance, better known as DeFi. We're going to be discussing crypto regulation, the recent actions taken by the US Treasury, along with the Securities Exchange Commission, and I am very thrilled to bring in our guest, Ari Redbord who is the Head of Legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs to discuss crypto regulation. And of course, the road ahead in 2023. Ari, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eHey, Kori, thanks so much for having me and really excited to join Public Live today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we're happy to have you and to have this discussion. We have a lot of crypto enthusiasts within our community and I'd love to start out by talking specifically about the US Treasury Department. They recently initiated a risk assessment related to illicit financial activities within the sphere of this DeFi space, in your opinion, are what are the primary vulnerabilities exploited by illicit actors in the DeFi sector?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, it's a really important question. And to kind of set the conversation a little bit, this risk assessment was actually ordered by the White House framework on digital assets, which came out about a year ago. So while it sort of created somewhat of a regulatory framework, it definitely tasked a number of agencies and one of the tasks was for the US Treasury Department to do a risk assessment on D fi. And really, really important to note that this is just that it's a risk assessment with a focus on sort of what are the risks in the ecosystem/ It is not guidance, and it is certainly not regulation. And throughout the document, really Treasury talks about the need to engage with the private sector, with other agencies, and really have a conversation about ultimately, sort of what guidance or regulation should look like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that said, it focuses on the areas that you see also in this sort of centralized crypto space, whether it's ransomware. Hacks are a huge vulnerability for the DeFi ecosystem. In 2022, According to us at TRM, we saw about 3.7 billion in hacks, and about 80, or more percent of those hacks were against the DeFi ecosystem, bridges, protocols, Dex is and that's what it's a real concern. So there's a lot in this thing, but really, really important to understand, like, why does it talk about risk? Well, you know, that's exactly what it was intended to do is provide a risk assessment of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, a risk assessment, I think, many people would probably agree that's definitely needed, given the nature of DeFi. And especially what's happened in the past six to nine months in the broader crypto sector. But I'd love to dig into it a little bit more, because there are illicit actors, right? There are people that are, you know, in this space that are not necessarily trying to do good things. And that's what I'd love for you to explain to our audience. All right, how do these criminals actually use DeFi services? To do things like launder ill? ill gotten gains?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, no, it's really important. And whenever I talk about DeFi, I'm currently the vice chair of the CFTC Technology Advisory Committee as well. And as I said at our last meeting, look, if you're going to talk about DeFi regulation, you really have to start with the promise of this technology, right? This idea of sort of on-chain financial services, where we can have peer to peer transactions, you know, at the speed of the Internet. I think the technology is really, really extraordinary. But anytime you can move funds across border at the speed of the Internet, there are going to be vulnerabilities and illicit actors are going to try to take advantage of it and I think the challenge is for regulators, and Treasury really lays this out, is how do we sort of provide regulatory guardrails to make this ecosystem safe, but at the same time sort of not stifle innovation? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the really, really big takeaways, I mean, I think, for me, the most interesting of this risk assessment, is what it says is sort of about regulation. And again, you know, this is not guidance, this is not regulation, but Treasury says, look, if you are engaging in financial services, whatever your level of centralization is, right? DeFi, CiFi, or traditional finance, you have regulatory obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act, which is the US anti money laundering law. And I think that's probably going to be the most controversial piece of all of this, because there are a lot of sort of, you know, folks in the DeFi space who say, look, this is truly decentralized, disinter-mediated software that doesn't have teams of compliance professionals, it's sort of what we've seen in the traditional space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think the regulatory piece is going to be a very big part of this. And to your question, I think what Treasury sees at least is, look, we have to ensure that there aren't gaps in regulation, and one of the gaps they see today is sort of non compliance in the DeFi space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, there definitely seems to be a lot of noncompliance. I want to pick up on something you said in terms of the Treasury, to look at how to not slow down innovation, but also, you know, providing, perhaps some type of risk parameters specifically, because we've seen this in other versions of tech, right, in different sectors where regulation has been at a much slower pace, right, than the actual technology and the innovation that's occurring. Is there something in what the Treasury is kind of proposing or what they're looking at that is specifically not going to slow down innovation? Are they always going to be two steps behind where DeFi is going? It?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri RedBord:\u003c/strong\u003eLook, I mean, government has always had this challenge. And I don't think we've ever seen anything move as fast in our lifetime, as we've seen the sort of crypto web three blockchain space. So it's always sort of this catch up game. Look, I think that you know, people are definitely appraising last week, the European Union, the European Parliament, passed Mica, the marketing crypto assets, legislation, really the first global sort of framework for digital assets, the sort of clear regulatory framework, and there's been a lot of praise around that. But when people sort of forget is that's about three years coming. That, you know, mica can't stem really from Facebook's sort of launch of the failed stable coin project Libra. So that's really three years ago, when European Parliament started thinking about Mica.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the reality is that yes, you know, governments and regulators are always going to be sort of far behind the technology. But at the same time, I think what we're seeing in this risk assessment is an acknowledgement by Treasury and the US government that it's so important to bring the private sector into these conversations, because what we do well in the private sector is innovate. And so far, I think we've seen some of those conversations already take place, which I think is a really good sign. In other words, I don't know that we're going to see enforcement actions, I shouldn't say, I don't think we're going to see enforcement actions from Treasury, again, sort of DeFi for not having compliance controls in place over the next year. So I think what we're gonna see is conversation,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eif we start to see those conversations. are those conversations spearheaded by the DeFi, by industry, by that sector, right? So that, by the time, you know, the government, so to speak, decides to catch up and actually put some regulation in place. They're basically doing their own internal audits, as you mentioned, compliance sort of thing. And they're already kind of lining up the sector to say, hey, these are the standards and rules that we're setting across the board. You know, while the government back on Capitol Hill just tries to figure out what they think it is we should do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, it's an excellent question, this sort of self regulation question that permeates the space. And I think, look, if you think about the native qualities of public blockchains, right, they're transparent. They're immutable. So in other words, they allow for tracing and tracking the flow of funds in ways you really never could in traditional finance. And that also allows us in many respects, to kind of regulate ourselves right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt TRM and a bunch of different industry players Circle and Binance and of others launched something called Chainabuse, which is essentially crowdsourcing, I think of it as the ways for crypto scams and frauds. It's a way this community can crowdsource to ensure that other people aren't taken by fraud and financial crime and you can report to law enforcement. So I say all of that to say like, I think that there are ways we can self-police the space in ways that were absolutely impossible in traditional finance, where we rely on intermediaries. So I think definitely, we are already seeing a world where not just DeFi but centralized exchanges are sort of coming together to sort of propose regulation and support regulation. But again, it's so important that this regulation doesn't go beyond what is intended to do and sort of stifle innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you talk about the companies and the things that people can do in this space, to perhaps self regulate, I guess it makes me think, Ari, what is what is after that, though, right? Because even if, regardless of if the government does it, or it's going to be self regulated, what happens to the illicit actors in the space? Are there sanctions? Are there obligations? If it's not going to be the government and it's going to be self regulated, who is the enforcer?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, it'll be the government, don't get me wrong, I think there's an aspect of self regulation that can actually absolutely occur, but I think it's gonna be a combination to be sure. And I will say this, look, you know, the nature of cryptocurrency, right? Cross border value transfer, this speed of the Internet is always going to be attractive to illicit actors. But when we see, you know, we see about the same amount of illicit activity in crypto as we do in the traditional financial system, which is a very, very small amount at the end of the day, almost infinitely small. So you're always going to have bad actors, right? If you don't have illicit actors in a financial system, it means the financial system is not robust, right? Bad guys are always going to want to engage, where sort of funds are flowing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that said, sort of the nature of crypto and the ability for regulators to have a view of their regulated ecosystem, in real time for law enforcement to be able to track and trace the flow of funds on public blockchains. This all means that crypto could be a lot safer, ultimately, than Fiat, which relies on sort of, you know, siloed, intermediaries who report to the government suspicious activity reports and this sort of thing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think the promise of the technology is, in part, the ability for regulators and law enforcement to use it and essentially, that's what we do at TRM. We provide software that enables that type of investigation and regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I mean, that's good to know that your company is obviously out there already in the marketplace providing solutions to some of these issues. I'd love to shift our attention, though, for a second really quickly towards the SEC specifically, because they did send Coinbase a WELLS notice in regards to the firm listing unregistered securities on exchange, and some time, as we know has passed since Coinbase actually received the notice are what specific violations of security laws has the SEC accused Coinbase of? It kind of seems like they sent a letter and like not much has happened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, look, there's this interesting..Certainly I'll first answer the question that is sort of, you know, the SEC is essentially saying look, Coinbase is listing unregistered securities, because certain cryptocurrencies are in SEC’s view, sort of most cryptocurrencies today are securities. And that's essentially the genesis of this letter. But that said, this is the issue that is permeating the entire space in the United States today. And it's really a definitional question, you know, are certain cryptocurrency securities? Are their commodities? Or are they something else? And every issue, whether it's sort of the CFTC, recent action involving finance, you know, talks about Ethereum as a commodity, but the SEC has talked about Ethereum as a security, or sees the asset rather as a security, and we see this letter to Coinbase. You know, there are cases involving, you know, sports celebrities and endorsers of FTX where one of the arguments in the case is that they were promoting unregistered securities. So ultimately, that question will be answered in that case, maybe from state to state courts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I say all of this to say that the biggest issue today in our space is, you know, are things commodities? Are things securities? And ultimately, you know, we're going to continue to see see enforcement actions and regulatory action, until Congress ultimately provides legal clarity and actually says, hey, look, Bitcoin is a commodity, and these other assets are you know, securities, or maybe even something else. And I think my view is that, look, you know, this technology is so new and so extraordinary, that maybe this can be something else. But I think the real issue is we need that type of legal clarity and probably needed from Congress. And until we get that, we're going to continue to see sort of disagreement amongst regulators and continued sort of enforcement actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, it definitely seems like the story continues to unfold in this space, because Coinbase as many of us know, here, they did take legal action against the SEC. And to be honest, that's not something you typically see companies do is take action against one of these government institutions, but this just happened on Monday related to the lack of clarity on securities regulations presented to the firm. Can you just explain for us? I'd love for you to break this down? What is Coinbase asking the court to do in its latest action against the SEC? And also did Coinbase do this, decide to take legal action against the SEC and for lack of a better term retaliation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, look, I think, you know, you know, obviously, this latest action by Coinbase is, you know, is sort of the latest example, but really what we've been seeing for the last, you know, several months or even more, really a year, are businesses looking for clarity from somebody, whether it's the courts, whether it's guidance from regulators, which is really in this case, sort of what Coinbase is asking the court to\u0026nbsp;make sure to get the regulator to provide, but it's like, look, you know, there's enforcement actions, you know, against us for listing unregulated securities in the words of Coinbase. But, you know, no one's ever told us, you know, what’s a security and what's a commodity here, they've only sort of proposed that, you know, we have obligations under a, you know, 60, or 70 year old Supreme Court case called US versus Howey where there's a conversation of whether or not orange groves and enterprise around orange groves are securities, are investment contracts. So I think what it is, is Coinbase and really, it's not just Coinbase it’s across the entire industry, is looking for clarity, you know, before you bring an enforcement actions, says Coinbase, or other entities, you know, we need an explanation, we need guidance from you as to what is a security and what is not a security?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and whether or not they get that guidance before all of this back and forth, you know, legal dispute that's now, you know, taking plays really comes to a head, I guess, only time will tell because, as you mentioned earlier, things are happening so quickly in this space quicker than we've seen, and other tech enabled spaces and there, there's a lot of moving parts right, Ari to work out here? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are so many and at this point, you know, we have the executive branch I mentioned, you know, our conversation today started with Treasury, right, and you have the SEC, and you have the CFTC. And you have the Fed, all involved in this. We have the legislative branch, we had a hearing last week on stable coins. And there's a proposed stable coin bill out there, which we're told is not going to necessarily, you know, move without some revisions. We have a number of other bills that have been proposed in Congress, but really no activity there. We have. And then we have the courts to your sort of last point, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we have all these different branches of government, you know, trying to sort of parse out a lot of these questions. But ultimately, it will come down to Congress to provide that sort of legislative clarity. And I'm not I'm not entirely sure that will be anytime soon. So we're likely to continue to see some of this sort of regulatory action from these agencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I'm sure that your company will, of course, be keeping a close eye on all the movements in this space, and we at Public will be definitely updating our community as things progress. Alright, I just want to thank you so much for joining Public live this afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is Ari Redbord - he's the head of legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs. Thank you so much, Ari.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eHey, thanks so much for having me and looking forward to coming back soon.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, perfect.

I'm Kinsey Grant, your host today and I am so excited to welcome on our fantastic guest. With us now is Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities.\u0026nbsp; Michael, how are you today?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I'm good. Thank you, Kinsey. Thanks for having me.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course super excited to have this conversation. Today we are going to be talking about Nintendo, more specifically the outlook for Nintendo as we move ahead into the rest of the year into some big launches for the company. We're going to get your perspective on what comes next for Nintendo. So if you're ready, we can kick right off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I'm ready.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAlright, sounds great. So Michael, can you give us a quick overview into Nintendo's business strategy, where it generates revenue, how it operates as a business. Tell me a little bit more about that 30,000 foot view. What is he big picture for Nintendo's business?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. They were founded in 1865, I think 1865 or 1869, I always get the year mixed up. And they were like a trading card company. And they kind of invented that in Japan, and you know, muddle along, made money and discovered video games in the 70s with arcade style games. So many people, I'm not sure very many of your viewers have actually ever played an arcade game in an arcade, but Donkey Kong was their first giant hit. And it was Mario running up a ramp and avoiding barrels being thrown by the gorilla who is Kong. So Donkey Kong was Mario trying to get past Kong, and get through all the levels and ultimately, free Princess Peach from being kidnapped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat allowed them to generate a lot of wealth, and they decided that they were going to bring the arcade experience to the home. So they're one of the early home console makers, Atari actually might have beat them to it. There's another company Colico, another company in television, all of them watch consoles around the same time in the 80s. And Nintendo’s was the most popular of the many consoles launched - the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. And I think that the reason that their console worked and the other guys didn't, is that Nintendo had content, that is, Mario to start. They kept expanding their content library, and they've launched consoles since 1990. The Super NES 1997 in ‘64. In 2001, the GameCube. In 2006 The Wii, which was enormously popular. Then they did the Wii U in 2013, which was terrible. And then the Switch in 2017, which has been very good. They've had a ton of handhelds. The Gameboy was the original, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Advance SP, the DSX you know, and then the 3DS before the switch. If any of your viewers have watched the new Apple TV plus movie, Tetris, that's actually the story of how the Tetris Company was formed, and the key was getting on the Gameboy. So the Nintendo platform was so popular that these guys were minting money. But at the same time, they've developed about 30 different big brands on the Nintendo platform that they own. So among them Zelda and Kirby, and the Smash Brothers Mario Kart, and so Mario is the biggest one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTheir strategy has really not changed much in the last 40 years. They've been focused on the console and their strategy is to create proprietary software meaning software they own for their proprietary console, so the only way you can play their game is to buy their console. And the other guys aren't that way, Sony and Microsoft have consoles, their total sales of first party, their own IP are under 10% of their total revenue. So, you know, Nintendo is more like north of 50 - it has been as high as 80%. So Nintendo has a different strategy than the other guys. And the departure recently from that strategy, which is not meaningful, but it's interesting is that they really started to focus on licensing their IP, and getting opportunities elsewhere. So you start to see them on mobile a bit. They're not really good at it yet. But again, they only own 31% of Pokemon Company, Pokemon Go, it's been a giant mobile title. But the big, big change lately is this Mario Brothers movie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the Super Mario movie is really driving a lot of awareness of the brand. And if you roll back, again, you're probably about 1. But back in 2000, there were surveys of the most recognizable brands of the 20th century. And you can look this up to this, this is findable on Google, the number one brand ahead of Coca Cola, you know ahead of anything else was Nintendo. So they are the most recognized brand on the planet. And yet, you know, their cumulative console sales, maybe have hit 250 million households, I don't think that could possibly be even close to a billion households. Yet, there are 3or 4 billion people on the planet who know what Nintendo is.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the recent strategy shift has been to license the content to other media, like movies, to get even more awareness of the brand. I think you're going to start seeing, you know, Nintendo lunch pails, lunch boxes for the kids, Nintendo pajamas, you know, Nintendo plush toys. And I think that'll work. And ultimately, what that does is drive greater awareness and more interest in the brand, which will help them sell software and hardware. So they do great. They're making tons of money, the hardware sales spiked during COVID. And they've kind of pulled back lately, but we're talking about the difference between, you know, 21-22 million hardware units down to maybe 19, or 20. So it's not like they got cut in half - they just peaked. And now they've plateaued. I don't see a lead up anytime soon. They're due for product refresh. They haven't launched a new console in a while. So probably next year, there should be a Switch 2 or something, some upgraded Switch. And Nintendo has been pretty smart on the hardware side. They try to build their hardware and sell it at a profit so they tend to use commodity components rather than cutting edge technology. If you look at Sony and Microsoft, they both lose money on every console, Nintendo makes money on every console. So as a consequence, their consoles are less powerful than the other two. But their content is great so it doesn’t seem to matter to their fans.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. And I think you bring up a really important point here, which is this idea that, you know, licensing IP, I think, for most of these companies that we're talking about, but not Nintendo specifically, I imagine the margins can be much higher on licensing IP than they can be on creating technology, creating software and hardware that require a lot of inputs that require a lot of very brilliant minds. And also a lot of parts to be made. You know that that is something that I don't want to discount here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut getting a little bit more into this idea of how important IP is for Nintendo as a company. Talk to me a little bit more about this. The Super Mario Brothers movie released in North America in early April pulled in around $380 million in its opening weekend, which is way I think out of you know, outperformed a lot of the expectations that were placed out there for this film. It was co-financed by Nintendo and Universal Pictures, how many more big, you know, major scaled projects like that, like a Super Mario Brothers movie do you see coming for Nintendo? You know, is this setting a new precedent for the company in terms of licensing IP or the project is going to be as big as you know, a major film release that blew expectations out of the water? Do you expect more of that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe economics aren't clear, and I know that the companies announced that the film was co-financed, but my understanding is that Nintendo didn't put any money in. Instead, they contributed the intellectual property obviously, and they lent technical talent so they let their creative developers Miyamoto, who is the head of their studios, to the project to ensure that the characters had brand integrity that they did.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you have Mario with five arms or or 10 fingers on each hand, and I think that it's likely that their net net profit on this will be something around, you know, 10% of the total film gross, which is still a big number, this film is going to do $2 billion, when they're all done, I mean, between box office and, and all the different DVD sales and pay per view and streaming service fees and licensing to broadcast TV. So they'll make a couple 100 million dollars, that's enough to get them interested in doing it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAgain, this is one of the bigger projects for Universal. And this is the biggest animated film opening I think of all time. So Universal certainly is going to be interested in doing more and more of this. And for Universal, they make even more money, obviously, because they own the animation studio. So they're going to want to do more and more and more. And there'll be a balance, I think that Nintendo doesn't want to over saturate the market. And they certainly don't want to have any brand failures. But I would expect that you'll see another film within three years. I don't think it's going to be annual for a while.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt takes a lot to be like Disney and put out, you know, a Marvel film every three months, which they do. I don't think Nintendo is there yet. Could they get to one a year in the next 10 years? Sure. So it's a nice profit contributor, but the bigger impact of the film is just brand awareness that, you know, they end up having, say 500 million people see the film, you know, at most half of those people are Nintendo current customers and the other half are not. And ultimately they're going to win over a whole generation of people who are going to be interested. And it also opens up the opportunity for them to sell, you know, figurines.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs an example, when the Mandalorian came out, I bought my wife a couple of Growgu characters, and we hadn't seen the show yet. She's like, Why do I want these? And now she thinks they're super cute.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo if Disney's brilliant at Merchandising, and Nintendo has not been. And I expect that Nintendo will get brilliant at merchandising, I think that could open up another couple of 100 million a year of profit. So I can see this company really building on the success of the Super Mario movie, but I can't tell you that they'll do anything for the next two or three years.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Totally, totally. And to your point, you know, the pace with which a company like Disney can put out movies in a franchise like Marvel is astounding. And you know, every single actor in Hollywood these days is somehow tied to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is wild. But with that in mind, it brings to I think, this conversation the the concept of going back to things that work versus creating a new idea or following some sort of new potential concept idea, or content idea or content concept, you know, when we think about Super Mario Brothers has been around to your point where it's being introduced to a new generation, but it was around for my generation, for the younger people in the generation ahead of me, you know that this not really a new franchise.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the same goes with Zelda. I know that there's a big release in the Zelda franchise happening next month that a lot of gaming creators are really excited for. But how important is it for Nintendo to come up with the next Mario or the next Zelda? Is that something that you think companies like Nintendo or even Nintendo itself are considering? Or are they really doubling down on returning to what they know works and adding new elements to those franchises that do work versus trying to come up with, you know, totally brand new ideas - blank white sheet of paper trying to figure out what's next?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, it's a great question. I don't see Nintendo innovating on their existing brands, you will see them create new brands like Animal Crossing, but new that probably is 10 years old. So it's not like that. That's something they did this past year, in the last 20 years. I doubt that they've done more than two big new brands. They have, I counted not for this interview I counted for another reason, there are 30 brands at Nintendo that have sold multiple millions of units of games. So they have 30 established franchises. I promise you Marvel doesn't have 30. I mean, we think that they have 4000 characters, but they don't have 30 brands. And, you know, Disney's managed to do something with that. DC doesn't have 30. You know, but the difficulty in exploiting those brands is, you know, that you have to create a fun, compelling story around them. And I think with 30 brands, Nintendo's got plenty to continue to pump out, you know, three or four big games a year, movies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's interesting because some brands are really great movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, where the brand itself as a comic book wasn't that big a deal. I mean, it was popular but I don't think anybody in this room, I'd say fewer than 10% of the people who are aware of the Guardians of the Galaxy brand will ever have seen the comic book. They learned about the brand from the movie. And that's the right way to build brands, you know that you don't have to build the brand on the comic book.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo an Animal Crossing movie might be good, or a Yoshi Island movie might be good. But we'll definitely get another Animal Crossing game. And we'll definitely get another Yoshi’s Island game. And as I said, there's so many of them that, you know, I don't think Nintendo has to worry about new IP anytime soon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotally - and Animal Crossing. I can't help but ask your perspective on the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on Nintendo as a business and how Animal Crossing became enormous. People were stuck at home, everybody wanted a Nintendo Switch, they were actually incredibly difficult to get for a time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm curious about how the you know, coming out of the the thick of the COVID 19 pandemic might impact how Nintendo moves forward knowing that they did have this this significant moment in the sun, I would say especially with the switch, which I believe is in its seventh fiscal year next, year heading into its seventh fiscal year next year. So it's not a brand new product, you mentioned that you're expecting some sort of a refurbish or a refresh.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow do you think Nintendo is going to rise to the occasion to make sure that you know now that everybody is kind of going back to their regular lives, not really at home quite as much, what is Nintendo going to do to make sure that those people want to buy the next generation of a switch?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e: Yeah, I mean, one of the things Nintendo has pioneered and yet failed to exploit adequately is the concept of user generated content. So they've created these Super Mario Maker software packages that allow you to create your own characters and do your own thing. Animal Crossing, let you do that, you can customize your character. And so when I say they pioneered it and failed to exploit, there were brands that were building things inside Animal Crossing. So you could literally wear Burberry, Burberry sweater, or carry a Louis Vuitton bag. And yet, Nintendo failed to exploit that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo they didn't create a storefront and let you know, only allow the brand to create the Burberry sweater and then let the brand sell you the sweater. And can you imagine if you could buy a Burberry sweater in the game for $1? You know, Burberry would have made 20 million bucks. And why not? Like how does that hurt them? You know, it has 20 million people, you know, wearing their sweater, it helps us. So I think Nintendo is smart. I think their management team is smart. I like the current CEO a lot.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe'll get that right in the next iteration. So that'll be fun. I think that again, who knows what they're going to do with that next generation switch. But if they allow more creator tools, and they allow you more interoperability, so maybe create something and broadcast that TikTok video or Twitch video through your console, which Sony allows you to do now, I think you get a lot more creative talents. And if you open up the opportunity to create to everybody, you end up enriching the world because you end up with something like America's Got Talent or American Idol, where you get these amateurs who are really talented, and they turn into superstars, you know, so Carrie Underwood, came out came off of a farm in Oklahoma and is a star. And it's hard to know that she would have been discovered but for the opportunity for amateurs to compete, you know, in public.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think Nintendo exploits that type of concept, and let's amateurs create within the switch to universe. I think they'll come up with really great content, and I think there's an opportunity to make money.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, incredibly interesting. Who's the Carrie Underwood for Nintendo is a fun question to ponder here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo Michael, I want to talk for a second here about risks and sort of the future, we’ll future cast just a little bit here. You have an outperform rating for Nintendo shares said in a recent report that the stock presents a favorable risk reward profile. I would love to hear you explain that just a little bit and talk to me a little about the risks that might materialize for Nintendo in the medium and long term.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey're a pretty dependable company. So they're pretty easy to forecast. Their hardware sales, as I said, don't vary by more than 10% either way. So the odds of them forecasting 20 million switch sales coming in at 10, that's pretty close to zero. They forecast 20 that comes in at 18, they're not going to be thrown from profit to loss, they're going to make a little less money. And it's just as likely that it goes from 20 million to 22. They still have the tool in their pocket of price cuts, and they haven't cut the price much if at all. They've introduced three now three models of the switch, they have the switch light, the regular switch, and the switch OLED.\u0026nbsp; I could see them cutting the price of each of those by 50 bucks, and suddenly you would see sales go up. And they'll still make money because the cost of manufacture and shipping has gone way down as the supply chain has gotten more normal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I really say low, low low risk on hardware. Software is more a function of release schedule. So you know, if they release a new game, every three months, they're fine. If they miss one, and it takes six months, they might not make as much profit as we forecast. And if they missed two or three, and we go a year or two without, without a new software title, that's a problem. But they've been pretty dependable since the Switch launch that I've seen them really miss anything. You know, delaying Zelda, a few months doesn't matter. That's time value of three months of cash, it's not that big a deal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I'd say risks are very, very low. The reward opportunity, you know, the upside is that when they cut price, they surprise us with a better lineup. And we get more software sales. You know, Zelda is not the best selling game of all time, you know, Mario Kart is, the big surprise for upside would be that there's a Mario Kart 9. You know, which the last Mario Kart I think came out in 2014. It's been a long, long time. So they're really due for something like that. That could be huge. And I would guess that that's their next movie. And so I would guess that you're going get Mario Kart game and Mario Kart movie kind of at the same time. And, and that's where I think they surprise the upside. So I, there's more opportunity for them to beat than there is for them to miss.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. All right. So Michael, this has been wonderful. I have one last question for you for the road. Before we wrap things up here. Just while I have you, Roblox. I would love to get your perspective. Your take on Roblox recently reported monthly key metrics for March that perhaps fell a bit short of expectations. I know you have a neutral rating and a $37 price target for that stock. What are your general thoughts just quickly on Roblox as a company right now,\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey, you know, they don't disclose their monthly active users, but the number is around 300 million. And that's not even close to saturation. I mean, they could get to a billion users. But the way to do that is to expand the product offering to appeal to people older than 20. And I don't mean to suggest that their content isn’t good, it is. It's just that as you age, you're much more interested in shooter games like Call of Duty, or, you know, role playing games like World of Warcraft.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so the way to get that type of content is to expand the platform. And the way to expand the platform is to rev share at a higher rate for recognizable content. I think they can. And I actually like their management. And I think that they know that they need to do this, but they haven't done it yet. So I don't see this company getting to the growth implied by its share price until they shift the business model, share more of the revenue with developers and attract games that appeal to older people. And you know, they have a couple of quarters of stagnant growth. That's really what's going on there. The growth is okay, but not as good as people expected. If they have a couple of quarters, stagnant growth, I expect that they'll make a shift. So I'm waiting until it happens. I guess I could forecast the exact date it will happen, but I don't know. If we see an indication that they're going to change them, then we obviously will look at them more favorably, but I haven't seen that yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. All right. Well, we'll just have to check back in at a later date. Michael, this has been so wonderful. Thank you so much for your time and all of your incredible insights. I've really enjoyed this conversation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you, Kinsey.

All right, folks. Let's do it. A very cool topic on a very timely day for it and well, we're joined by Mark Mahaney, Senior Managing Director at Evercore ISI, the research division to talk all things Amazon and like I said, what a day for it. Amazon entering the generative AI race through AWS with the introduction of bedrock you may have seen in the headlines the last few hours. It's set to allow clients to leverage and customize AI tools to generate text similar to the way the Chat GPT does. And Mark Mahaney is here who else better to talk about it. We'll also talk a little bit of tech preview as well ahead of earnings season. Mark, thanks for being here. Nice to have you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eGood to be here. Thanks for including me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. I do need to embarrass you just a bit with a plug. For people who don't know, Mark is also the author of a new book – it’s called “Nothing But Net: 10 Timeless Stock-Picking Lessons from One of Wall Street’s Top Tech Analysts,” and we are doing book giveaways here at Public. So, if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the Public live handle. Okay, Mark, thank you for being here. First, congrats on the book, I first want to just get your takeaway for the shareholder letter. It's always nice to hear from Andy Jassy. What most stood out to you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat most stood out is that, like every year, this is kind of a thoughtful review of what's happened to the company over the last year and what their current priorities are for the next year – I know that sounds really basic. I think all CEOs should write shareholders like this. In the book I went through the first 25 first years of the Bezos shareholder letters, and I pulled out key themes from each year. There was a dramatic focus on customer satisfaction and a dramatic focus on innovation – and you kind of still see that here today. But, if there were a couple of new themes that really stuck out, cost – focused on cost efficiencies, and there's a series of items in this letter about how they looked at all of their businesses, whether it was AWS, retail, both international and in the US, their advertising business, the layoffs and just kind of a recognition that demand trends have softened, and they needed to tighten their belts. And so that was one – that was new. I mean, I think you would have seen this in 08-09, you know, back during the great financial crisis, but we haven't had a shareholder letter focus on cost reductions and cost efficiency, so it's a sign of the times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then I think the second area had to do with innovations in each of the segments. So, in retail, they have sped up deliveries and they talked about Prime deliveries should be at their fastest pace this year like if you're ordering Amazon retail products via Prime, you should get the product faster this year to your home, to your apartment, wherever than you did in the past, that's a good investment. They also tease some of these improvements that you also teased on the AWS side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the third point is just a reminder that Amazon's actually been aggressively investing in machine learning and artificial intelligence, you know, for the better part of a decade, and it's in there in terms of the product announcements, the the product feed, or the recommendations that they've given, and it's been in there in terms of the AWS products, the bedrock announcement is a little different. But you know, it's a different level, it’s different scale, but the investments have been there – and so I think they kind of also wanted to use a shareholder letter, Andy did, just to kind of raise his hand and say, “Hey, I know we didn't talk about the last earnings call, but we actually are a machine learning and AI company and by the way, we have been for a decade.” So I thought those were the three most interesting things in the shareholder letter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we also heard him on that last earnings call as well, which I think all of us that listen in on those sorts of things, we want to hear from someone in that position. We haven't historically, and we don't always from big companies. So that's worth noting as well. I wonder, before we move on, was there anything with regards to macro concerns to how the company is positioned for high interest rates? I don't know that we would hear much directly with concerns over tightening credit or potential credit crunch like we do a lot of other companies, but anything you think, for people to know, in terms of potential way, big picture headwinds for the company?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't think so. The line in here that I'm staring at now is, “While the short term headwinds soften our growth rate, we'd like a lot of funnels now fundamentals that we're seeing at AWS.” So they're acknowledging the short term headwinds, right up front, and they should, because you know, if you step back on AWS, this was a 30% year-over-year revenue grower up until the middle of last year, and now in this March quarter that they're going to print in two to three weeks, the dates not set yet, they're going to print something like 12 13%, like the growth rates have been cut in half in in a year's time, that's always something that's a little bit alarming, and for any company, but I think it's very much a reflection of softening macro environment. And then what Amazon is doing, or AWS is doing to respond to that, which is they're aggressively going after and bringing down pricing in order to help their customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eSo you mentioned, it seems as if the company was pretty eager to remind people to say, hey, we're still here in the AI conversation, folks who really haven't gotten anywhere, obviously, much of the chatter may sort of be dominated by other names in the space. But talk to me more about what we learned about bedrock specifically, and any other thoughts, Mark that you have, as they look to integrate it into its cloud offering, certainly a big priority for the company at a really important time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, unlike Microsoft, and Google, Amazon's not going to have a generative AI LLM – “Large Language Model” out there. But what they are doing is AWS’ bread and butter has always been selling to devs. What I mean by that is developers, the people who create the large language models, and so they're just that that's kind of what they're doing with bedrock, which is saying that they're rolling out more tools to help LLM developers GAI, that's Generative AI developers, build their models build their tools, that just reminding people that, you know, they, there are tools provider, that's where they're playing in this, this AI race, in addition to doing normal things like storage and compute for their customers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I don't know if that's helpful or not, you're going to see them kind of in the weeds on generative AI and in the weeds on LLMS,\u0026nbsp;allowing developers, creators to create and develop those models, rather than, you know, running the flashy front-end consumer service. So that's also why they'll probably be somewhat under-appreciated in terms of their AI competencies. I just think the broad point is, Amazon's fully involved in AI. They've been using it to improve their processes, they've been using artificial intelligence for everything from book selections to you to where in a warehouse where they actually put products so that they can most quickly have people or robots pick up those products and put them in packages and ship them off to you. And then they use it for advertising and they use that in AWS. So that's just a reminder, because I think maybe the market needed one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, well, to that point, do you think the company almost deserves more credit or deserves to be more a part of the active chat GPT AI adjacent conversation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, they do. But you need to think about them as a company that’s already been investing in machine learning and AI for their core operations. And then when it comes to large language models, which is what Chat GPT is, they're the company – that’s who open AI will use. Actually, I don't know if they use AWS, but the other open AIs because there's a lot of other large language models and applications being built, they'll be built or a substantial percentage of them will be built on AWS. So AWS is kind of the tools vendor, the picks and shovels vendor, to the AI community, to the generative AI community. That's something that I think the market had kind of forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. Andy Jassy said this morning on Squawk he doesn't focus too closely on the company's stock price. What did data say – it's currently up 4.4%, with under two hours left in training here, you have an outperform rating, if I'm not mistaken, you recently lowered your own price target to 155 from 160. Again, with a bump today, it's trading right around 102. Talk to me about your decision to bid more, Mark, to drop that target and are you still finding yourself being positive for a long term case?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I can be near term cautious. I do think what he's saying in the shareholder letter, and he's warning people, is that trends are softening\u0026nbsp;even at AWS. And, you know, the facts of the facts, we've had a dramatic deceleration and growth rate, you know, you go from 30% to 10% revenue growth in a year, year and a half. That's not healthy, that's not bullish. And I think that things are likely to get worse at AWS before they get better, but they will get better. And, and for long term investors, which is what I really pitch people to be on Amazon, I pitched that you'd think about Amazon in 2023, is what I would call a DHQ stock, that's the concept that's in my book a “Dislocated High Quality” stock. Another way to think about it is it's a trough multiple stock on trough earnings. And you know, it's cyclical. And as these companies get bigger and bigger, of course, they're more cyclical, you can't escape the economy if you become a bigger, bigger contributor to it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what I think is so interesting about the setup on Amazon is, there may be a little disappointment about AWS results in the March quarter, or the June quarter guide, but we're going to get revenue growth acceleration as we go into ‘24, for their advertising, business, retail business, and for AWS, and you're going to get margin expansion and improvement and free cash flow. And I'm telling you all that when the stock is sitting here at a multi-year, multiple or trough multiple, a low multiple, and so that's, you know, that's the time when you step in, and you can make money, you may even be dealing with volatility over the next quarter. I don't know that there's a ton of downside volatility, but there'll be some. And I think if you're willing to look out a year, I think this is a great time to buy Amazon shares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't want to pull the conversation away from Amazon, but I'm hoping quickly, can you talk to us more about DHQs and any other household names people may be familiar with and why they fit that mold?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eGoogle is another one I think that fits that DHQ category. The old saying in the market says buy low, sell high, and I'm kind of saying buy high low. So you know, find a high quality company measured, you know, the book goes through it, but measured on the how good the management team is, how good the level of product innovation is at the company, how large the market opportunities, find those high quality companies and just wait for them to get dislocated, because they all get dislocated because there are market rollovers. That's obviously what we faced in Texas last year. There are mis-executions, because no company is perfect and they’ll make mis-executions. And then when you get those pull backs in the stock, that's when you step in, but first find a high quality company and I'll just take my reputation as I have historically that Amazon is one of those I think Google is to and it seems to me like the fears, you know, the near term and long term fears are well overstated on both of these names. I think they're both very good franchises so those would be two. You know, you can buy at a multiple, you can buy Google and Amazon at about the cheapest multiples you've had a chance to buy at in the last five years. I don't think you're going to regret buying both of those stocks here as DHQ opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eI have all potential opportunities for Amazon, whether it's logistics, groceries, health care, talk to me about what you personally are most excited about. What do you think makes the most impact? Or is it something that maybe we haven't even yet discussed, Mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let me check off some items or count them out. People talking about what Amazon is doing in healthcare - that's always been a head scratcher for me.\u0026nbsp;I'm just not convinced that – I think that's a huge market, but doesn't mean that Amazon should be going into it, so I'm skeptical about that. So I just want to start off with what I'm skeptical about.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I'm positive about is I think they can be a lot bigger and advertising now that they've just got a lot more content. All of their advertising, most of their advertising revenue so far has come from sponsored ads within their shopping results. But if they start putting advertisements against all of that premium content, video content that they have, I think that's a segment of the business that can double in the next five years, their advertising business. And then I want to get a little bit more blue sky, I talked about this, that logistics business, that buy with Prime. I mean, that's the FedEx competitor, that's the UPS competitor, and I'm pretty damn sure that Amazon's going after that, and it's tiny, tiny, tiny for them now, but I think that its low margin business, but Amazon knows how to handle its low margin businesses, I think that's going to be one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the last one I'd point to is business and industrial supplies. And I think what Amazon's vision here is to, is to connect the world's factories with the world's consumers, and, the world's factories with the world's businesses and people under-appreciate that latter one. And so it's industrial supplies, business supplies, look, Amazon's got the fulfillment network out there. They've got vans and people who deliver products to consumers, it's just a different stop. Now, there's a lot of other things that go into getting into procurement cycles for businesses. But I think that that's a big opportunity. I'm actually surprised they're not figuring that now. So that to me, is kind of one of the sleepers. So, the big sleepers for me are that, advertising and then that logistics business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eReal quick, not the most important question I'm going to ask you, but what's your favorite show on Amazon Prime since you mentioned content? I ask the important stuff, Mark. I'm a very serious journalist, you know me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eI think you've got me. I can tell you what my favorite books that I've been reading on Amazon Kindle. I'm not much of a movie person. You asked the wrong guy. I apologize.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, no –\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003efair enough. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Lots of good book options as well. Let me ask you about earnings season, of course, right around the corner. In your last note or a recent note, rather, you say you are tactically constructive. Talk to us more about that line of thinking, what you would want people to know, and some of the key factors that are driving that particularly out there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so we're making four points. One is that multiples have been de-risked. estimates have been de-risked. What we've had are all these job cuts, you know, cost actions, as painful as they are, over the last year, over the last six months really, these intense rounds of layoffs and, and cuts that's created what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. This is the third reason why we're more tactically constructive – because when eventually revenue growth really accelerates it is going to do it on a lower cost base. So that means you're going to get a real launch, or slingshot when it comes to earnings. And then the fourth reason why we're tactically constructive, or really constructive is AI. I think there's a lot of opportunities for digitally savvy companies and I think there's a fair number of them in the internet space, to take advantage of AI models and really create something interesting. So I think there are these reasons and so then I'll just end up with what stocks do we like? Well, our number one pick here is meta. Number two pick is Uber. And number three pick is Netflix. Those are 2023 stock picks. If I'm willing to look longer than that, I'm definitely throwing Amazon and Google into the mix.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eNice.

I'm your host Ann Berry and in this session, we are getting the lowdown or the down low on the high end luxury retail market and diving into the businesses of Hermes and LVMH. With us now is Marie Driscoll, Senior Analyst at Coresight Research to unpack their business models a little further. Marie, thank you so much for joining today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you for having me. It's an honor and a privilege.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, can you just talk about - super high level just to paint the picture for us - the current state of the luxury retail market and how it has been impacted by inflation and a slowing growth outlook?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So this is 2023. New Year, new time. The last few years, you know just to recap, luxury really skyrocketed during COVID luxury products are the most experiential of all products. And while people were locked in, unable to travel, unable to eat out their lives somewhat constrained, they sought luxury products and a lot of people had additional income because you weren't spending on experiences. So luxury became the new experience. And in fact, the luxury market captured a lot of new consumers. As we ended 2022, there's still you know, in America, there's a lot of pent up demand for travel. We were traveling last year to Europe where you saw lots of luxury purchases transpire in Europe, where in 2021, many of them, and in 2020, they occurred in the US market. The U.S. market took over as the number one market in the last few years where it had been like China are the number one consumers it moved to America. We've seen a lot of shifting happen in the last few years. So as we enter this year, you have a shift back to experiences which consumers want to have, they want to travel and travel has inflationary prices of 25 to 50%. Consumers want to eat out, there's inflation across the board, and the economy is somewhat weakening. So that's one backdrop that's happening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the same time, though, you have the China market opening up. We saw that happen in February. China was really under a lockdown last year so luxury really suffered. So as the Chinese began to travel domestically, and then as this year and next year progressed internationally, they will resume their – we assume they'll resume their love affair with all things luxury. So the big things as we head into this year are the pace of the reopening of China post the pandemic and what was a dampened demand for China for luxury by the Chinese is that resume. And then what's happening in the U.S. economy, there's mounting job losses with the Vigilant fed fighting inflation. The stock market is volatile, and these are factors that impact consumer sentiment and their willingness to spend on discretionary purchases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut as I said, during COVID, we got a lot of new luxury shoppers. It's projected that by 2030, about 75% or more of all luxury purchases will be made by millennials and younger. You have a lot of people that discovered luxury and luxury is sticky. Luxury is better quality. It romances people. It impacts the way people think about themselves. And we believe that they'll be trading down in some more commodity type products, like in the brown beans that you buy, maybe in the jeans that you buy.\u0026nbsp; In apparel, we see a trade down, but luxury we think has stickiness. That said, you know, if you lose your job, you're not going to be buying luxury products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Let's talk about stickiness, mobile, let's also talk about it in the context of pricing. I feel as though there are constantly these articles being published about how Rolex watches Hermes bags, have seen prices skyrocket under the guise of inflation in part but also because demand seems to have gone up from these new demographics. Can you talk about how price sensitive or not luxury is? Not all luxury is created equal if you break it down by category for us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e No, no. So not all luxury is created equal and I mean, the real trick of luxury and really any product category is to best match supply and demand. With luxury you want to have demand outpacing supply. And that's what happened during COVID. More people wanted an Hermes handbag or wanted an Hermes bracelet. Then Hermes was able to meet that demand. Some of it was supply chain constraints, and some of that there were more people entering the market that wanted these things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou also see that in resale if you're a student of the markets, you see that resale has provided pricing transparency into your first purchase. So you could buy a Hermes handbag newer or\u0026nbsp; Louis Vuitton handbag new and see that in the aftermarket, you can get 80 to 150% of what you paid for. So it's brought a new kind of shopper into the market. Also, if you buy in consignment it is where you can often meet that need for a luxury product today. You don't have to wait six months for it. It's In the aftermarket.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNot all products are equal. Certainly Hermes is, you know, unique in its ability to keep consumers panting for demand of you know their Birkin bag or their Kelly bag. But, and you've seen while Gucci was really driving incredible demand through COVID. By the end of COVID. Really, it became.. it was time to move on to another product. So partly as luxury becomes entwined with high priced designer brands, designer design and fashion are different than true luxury.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd let's talk a little bit about where Hermes and LVMH specifically fall on the luxury pricing spectrum. Marie, do you expect the higher end brands like there to be more recession proof than mid tier luxury brands? I mean, as you look at overall demand as distinct printers, price sensitivity, where do you see those learned?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are two different companies. Hermes has this one brand with sub-brands. Birkin is a brand, but it's really one brand, Louis Vuitton is a company that consists of about 80 different luxury brands. So with LVMH you're getting incredible diversification that spans Sephora and beauty, which is our entry points for luxury and in fact is holding up quite well. DFS, which is another part of their selective retail group. But they have some real winners with Louisville Vuitton and Christian Dior and then they have some more fashion brands like a Kenzo that are more vulnerable to an economy than the LDN, then the Louis Vuitton. And then of course, you have Tiffany's, you have all their jewelry lines.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what we saw in 2008 and 2009, is that luxury did not go down as low as other categories and it rebounded more quickly than other consumer discretionary categories. And we think that that will be the case again, this, you know, in this current economic environment, and frankly, this environment is nowhere near what 2008 or 2009 was with the Great Recession. Right now, like we're not even sure if we're in a recession, right? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnne Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, yes. So I think we're not sure if we're in a recession now and it's much more about the outlook. You've talked about Asia demand. Let's call it something else geopolitically that's different today versus in 2008 and that's the impact on Russian demand for luxury goods. Talk to us a little bit about what demand from Russia has looked like in the past and where it stands now, given the conflict with Ukraine?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So Russia, it is not a support as it was in 2008 or2009. Or, you know, it was part of the picture. But now you have a growing UAE, you have a youth that is entering the luxury market. And so I think that, you know, what's different now is there's more people in the market. We recently presented a Shop talk and in 2000, when we entered this century, 3% of the Chinese were in the middle class, by 2018 53% were. I mean, you have a huge middle class of 700 million people that buy luxury. They may buy low, and they have pent up demand from COVID for the last two years. So that's going to help them this year. The UAE has always sought luxury, but now they're bringing it to their own territory and we see a lot of demand coming there, which will offset the loss of the Russian consumer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTalk to us a little bit too, Marie, about direct to consumer and how luxury has been able to sell online, you know, you think about the stereotypical luxury experience, it's very much in person, it's tactile, you see the product, you feel the product, you try the product, if you're paying such high prices, has that evolved?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo their pricing is consistent, you know, the luxury brands are going direct to consumer because they can, they're in selected points of distribution where they want to be often they're renting space in a wonderful department store like a Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue or Bloomingdale's. But going direct to consumer means that you hope that you have control of your messaging at all points, and your adjacencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDuring COVID we saw and we continue to see throughout America, that luxury brands are opening more direct to consumer out physical stores to be where the consumer is because during COVID many consumers moved from metro areas to urban and rural areas. We just did a survey in China and it's more important for the Chinese that they want to discover luxury in physical store locations. And another interesting facet is that they're influenced more by their friends than they are by a KOL. So I urge you folks to check out Coresight’s research and look for our most recent survey on the China luxury consumer. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut so, but direct to consumer is just a way for them to really control what they look like in every point of sale and online. You can get selected products but luxury, is experiential, as you said, and not all the apparel is going to be or the ready to wear, not all the collection is going to be available online. But it's as easy as during COVID the consumers picked up the phone and call their sales associate. And and they were doing one to one selling kind of like one to one live shopping.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, just to finish our conversation, which has been just so interesting. With respect to Hermes and LVMH in particular, can we just go back to something you touched on early, which was the second hand market? We know that both Hermes and LVMH generate about half their revenue from the leather goods category, which is one secondhand market? And then you've got jewelry and others? Can you talk about the second hand appetite for those different product categories?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so I know better the second hand you know, the RealReal's of the world, the best year collective. A lot of it is the leather goods, you know, if you're a shopper and you love luxury goods and you buy some luxury clothing, you see that it drops, unless it's the most iconic of pieces, it drops in value, like 50 to 80%. The handbags hold their value, as I said before, and you get 80 to 150% of what you pay for. The thing about the secondhand market is that you can attract a new consumer to your brand there. A lot of brands, luxury, contemporary are bringing resale on their own branded platform so that they can keep that connection with the consumer. And there's been advances in technology and tagging so that luxury brands can keep track of who owns their product.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll this is to say that secondhand is really very viable. A luxury shopper cares about sustainability. And this secondhand is a feature of sustainability. It shows a prolonged life, it validates a purchase and it validates quality, something that has an extended life. An interesting feature that has come out with the recent RealReal report is that consumers are looking for vintage products and they're looking for handbags that are in fair condition, not necessarily in excellent condition because they want a handbag with the patina of use, which is really interesting. They want to look like they've owned this handbag for 10 years not for you know the last month. Interesting, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat is very interesting.\u0026nbsp; And part of my last question, which comes to mind if you can get your crystal ball out for us, Marie, and look at the next six to 12 months out? How do you see that trend evolving? And what are some other evolving consumer and luxury retail trends you can see coming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I think luxury holds up. I think that, you know, depending on how bad the economy is, you will see an impact. It's more muted in luxury but it you know it does participate in the economy. I think you'll see perhaps people trading into second hand also monetizing what they have in their closet to support their next luxury purchase.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdditionally, beauty will do well. Beauty has become a form of wellness, it's a form of taking care of oneself. So all the and fragrance has become more important in terms of self expression and taking care of oneself. So I think that we're going to see beauty grow, and you see that caring brings beauty in house. So beauty will become a more important feature of overall luxury and luxury will hold up and luxury has less volatile earnings and they can sooner you know, slow down their manufacturing and again keep their supply demand that equation in balance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWith that Marie Driscoll thank you so much for joining us Senior Analyst at Coresight Research.

We're going to be covering lots of things from The possible TikTok ban and its potential impact. With us today, once again is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. He is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 timeless stop picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts and we are doing a book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public live handle. You see it right there on the top of your screen, folks. All right, it's time to get into it. Hi, Mark. Welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, Kori. Good.

I don't know if you're aware a lot in the financial industry has changed. But today we're gonna focus on the tech stuff and what's happening with TikTok, I mean, the company's CEO, he provided that testimony. He was on Capitol Hill this morning, where he really received some tough, tough criticism with one lawmaker even stating, and I quote, I expect today, you'll say anything to avoid this outcome, but we are not buying it. What were your takeaways from the TikTok CEOs testimony?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that none of my children ever have to go on the Capitol Hill and testify with the weekend that he had, I wouldn't wish that fate on my greatest enemy. So I'm sorry to carry on being kind of glib about it. But that was, you know, I respect him. And I respect him for going up there and taking that, it's kind of like Zuckerberg, you know, in the last year or two or two years ago, being brought up to Capitol Hill to testify. It's kind of like the leaders of tech being brought up there Bezos and, and Tim Cook, etc, are being brought up to testify that was just unfortunately for TikTok, they're going up against two major issues, social health concerns, related to social media usage. And then much more importantly, these days is national security issues. And so, you know, you knew that the question was just how much defense he could play in that time, and I didn't watchall of the testimony. But that's what I was just struck by and I think maybe more importantly, just today's testimony, the action question for all of us as public market investors because we can't invest in TikTok or, or at least not as a separate standalone asset. I don't think we'll ever see it that way, is what are the implications of this for other social media assets, specifically, Snap, Meta, and Google? And I think the probability of TikTok getting banned in the US is just increasing, you know, relatively materially over the last 12 months. I know there are a lot of constitutional issues around this. And I think they're very serious. But I just think that the odds of some sort of ban or major restriction have increased materially. And so that's kind of a pending catalyst. And anytime the news flow comes up, you'll see names like Snap and Meta outperform on that day, which is what you're seeing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel what I'm hacking a little bit more in terms of the broader social media context, because you did reference, you know, Zuckerberg having to go up there kind of, you know, defend all the stuff that Facebook, you know, had going on all the negative things specifically, right, that was happening. I mean, you even saw back in the day with Dorsey, he had to go there. Back when he was still leading his company. He co-founded Twitter. I mean, you see it across the board, it doesn't seem to be net like it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon. And one of my takeaways from what happened today with TikTok, specifically, Mark is that I feel like they're also getting the brunt of all of the aforementioned right, big social media companies. It's like they've had enough time at the batting cage, right? With the Facebooks, with the Googles of the world, with the Snaps that now they're just ready to unleash completely on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori, I think that's right. But no, but don't forget this. I mean, we got a major political issue, growing political tensions between the US and China. And that's what made this tougher, I think, than anything that the tech companies had to face before because, you know, they,Those are US companies, you know, presenting in front of their elected representatives. That's not the case with TikTok and at the moment when relations between the US and China are at the lowest that they've been and, you know, I'm no expert on that. But um, in some time and maybe decades, so it's just, there's just a lot of different angles here that made it much tougher for TikTok to come through and again, it's kind of hard to see a political out here because it looks to look from where I stand it, it looks like the US military has banned Tiktok from personnel devices, personal and personnel devices. You've had more states do that. You've had a federal government do that you'd like that. That's from government-owned devices. So you've already gotten pretty far down the path here. You've never had that happen with any of the other apps. So and that's not because there's a greater social health issue related to TikTok than there was to Snap or to Facebook. It's because of the Chinese national security issue. So that this is just a bigger, this is just my this is more explosive of an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e No, it definitely is something else that you brought up earlier is that you know, you don't think there will ever really see TikTok, as a standalone kind of investable company where people like you or myself, your company would be able to then you know, buy shares in TikTok, it is owned by ByteDance. However, are there some scenarios perhaps in your mind Mark that could play out if TikTok were forced to sell or spin on where it could become, you know, a company at some point that you are I could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well I don't think so. There was an article in the papers this morning in China that the Chinese government for the first time made an official statement that they would be strongly opposed to a forced sale of TikTok. So I mean, I'm no expert on China, I just assumed that there would be some statement that would come out along the way to this effect. Well, it's out. So I think that's why a ban is such a distinct probability, because I don't think ByteDance will be allowed, even if they wanted to, and I don't think they want to, they wouldn't be allowed to sell TikTok to a US company. So TikTok's in the middle of a geopolitical Firestorm that's, it's unfortunate for them. And you know, I give them all credit. This is a highly innovative company now, whether they actually create a national security risk, that's, you know, there are thorough, thoughtful arguments on that. But anyway, that probably matters. Neither here nor less, it doesn't matter now, Kori, we're not gonna be able to get the chance to invest. So let's focus on the companies that could be derivatives of there. That's Meta. Alphabet because of YouTube and Snap. And I really do think sometimes we spend a little too much time on Snap as a derivative. I think that the use case you know, for those who have used TikTok a lot, you think about what other assets like Snap is more of a communications tool than that kind of leaned forward entertainment tool. That TikTok is but the analogies are really, Instagram and YouTube and those would be the beneficiaries where they were TikTok to be banned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, that was a foreign mission company is like Google because of YouTube likes Facebook, obviously, also owns Instagram. This is a perfect lead into my next question, because I know over at Evercore, you guys recently hosted a panel with three experts who collectively oversee $1 billion in ad budgets, these are companies that have really been struggling right in the ad space. But the panel revealed some signs that this ad a winter it could be starting to thaw, could you provide some insight into what you're seeing in the ad space, and how we could you know, positively impact some of those other companies that we could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think we're still in an ad winter, I think that's what we've uncovered so far with, with the channel checks that we've done, maybe that's not terribly surprising. And, you know, there's a broadening consensus that, that we do have a recession coming. So you know, we could be staying in an ad winter for quite some time. I don't think we're going to see crocus's anytime soon. I think Kori, those are the first plants that show up in the snow out of the snow, but you're also into horticulture Mark, you're a man of many talents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e And somebody can correct me on my pronunciation of crocus's. But, but, but I, I don't, I don't think we're gonna get a quick V shape recovery in marketing spend in advertising spend. And so that's going to be a bit of a drag on some of these names. The advantage and one of the reasons we like Meta frankly, one of the reasons it's our number one recommendation is you don't need to believe that to be long Meta, because they've taken so many of the costs out of their business. And then they've got this new reals, monetization, and they're doing much better targeting than they were years ago. And if you've got this new ad format called click to messaging, click the message which is used much less than the US but it's widely used outside of the US especially in areas of the world like Latin America and parts of Asia. And that's, that's a it's a brand new there's like a product cycle here. You need a product cycle because the overall market is getting soft, and it's not good. It's not firming up yet it's not getting better. And we're still in an ad winter and you know, we should probably assume we're gonna continue to be one for as it's gonna be a long winter it's gonna be several more months at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark I don't know. I remember you being this type of pessimistic in terms of the ad winter continuing and then you brought up the dreaded R word recession, goodness, a lot of things in what you just said that are very important takeaways. I'm gonna keep it moving, though, because Amazon, this is a company that has been doing a complete like 180 in terms of its firing, it's not doing the speed hiring anymore. They just announced on Monday, they're gonna lay off another 9000 employees. Do you have any thoughts on this mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think the big backdrop here is actually I thought Amazon was the first of the major tech companies to acknowledge that they had over hired overbuilt during the COVID crisis, they said this on their march 22 earnings call that was the that would have been last April, so about a year ago, but then they didn't really act on it. Whereas I think Facebook didn't acknowledge it early, but then they acted on it by laying off a good number of employees. Look, these layoffs are they're no fun for anybody there painful for all people involved. I've gone through it. And, so I wish it on nobody but you know, just as consumer households have to tighten their belts when times get tough. So do corporations, and especially those that over-hired and over-extrapolated from COVID demand trends. And Amazon was one of those, you could actually look they grew their expenses faster than they grew their revenue, and their revenue grew quickly, from 2019 to 2022. So they did overbuilt, they acknowledged it, and they needed to do one or two rounds of cuts, and they've done the two rounds of cuts. As long as we don't go into a steep recession, I don't think they need to do another round of cuts. But doing those cuts was necessary. You also had a bit of a change in but you've had a major change in management over the last two years. It's given a new CEO who's been with the company for 20 years. So he's not new to Amazon by any means. But it gets given them some time to maybe look through all the portfolio of bets, and assets that Amazon hasn't maybe pair some things back maybe not lose $10 billion a year on Alexa, which was a reported number, which was terrifically high. So anyway, I think I think that's kind of what you're getting out of Amazon, which is they're getting deep now into belt-tightening. And I do think that at the end of the day, when we come out of this, and when we get back to more normal economic times, companies are going to be doing this on the lower cost base. And that means you create what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. So when the revenue recovers on a lower cost base, that means that earnings can grow much faster. And that can be a great long equity opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's definitely hope that it will be really quick, Mark, before I get you out of here. I know that you are recently out in Las Vegas for the PROSPER show, which is a gathering of E-commerce sellers and solution providers just really quickly for all the rest of us who were not able to attend the show. What insights did you take away about the Amazon marketplace from that show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's still remarkably a positive experience for most sellers that are on there. And I think you're seeing a lot of them. I guess one of them the most part, the single most interesting takeaway for me was, I think it was 8 out of the 10. Amazon Marketplace, sellers that we spoke to are currently using advertising on Amazon. And Amazon don't tell anybody this but they're generating close to $40 billion a year in advertising revenue, they're going to be the next $100 billion a year ad revenue company. And that's not going to be next year or the year after. But sometime in the next three to five years. They'll be up there. I mean, they're gonna be in spitting distance of Facebook and Google. And because it's a high-intent platform and marketers and advertisers love to be in high-intent platforms. So that was probably the biggest takeaway. Merchants really like advertising on Amazon, watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow. Well, the faculty said they're going to be in spitting distance of those big behemoths like Google and Facebook. That's definitely something to watch. As always, we love when you come on Public lot to share your insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, the senior managing director and head of internet research team over at Evercore ISI.

It's called the Solana Saga - big announcement for the company. Solana announced on Thursday that the Saga is now available and will be shipped on the 20th of April for those who pre ordered and open for orders on May 8 for everyone else.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHere to discuss the new phone and really how it might be able to revolutionize web3 itself is Anatoly Yakovenko. He's the co-founder of Solana and CEO of Solana Labs. Anatoly, thanks for being here. Great to have you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Thank you for having me.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course. So let's begin with the most obvious question, at least to me, why the need for something like Saga right now in the marketplace?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, if you've ever imagined what crypto should be like, once we actually get to full adoption, you can imagine that world with a phone that's not your hardware wallet, it just makes sense. Right? Like it's the device you use every day, it has all the technology necessary for signing and transactions to be secure. It's just not enabled yet. So myself, I spent most of my career at Qualcomm and some of my closest colleagues worked on the technology that we're using to enable this. They literally built the Snapdragon trust zone. So as soon as I started working on crypto, it was just always in the back of my mind, when are we going to enable this on a Qualcomm device. So I'm pretty excited to actually get this to market and the level of security that this provides, I think, is so close to what a mobile phone could do, in terms of being a hardware wallet. So I'm really excited to bring that to consumers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd to the point about bringing that to consumers. Talk to me about how you envision this new look, web3 experience to be especially on a device, an Android device and, and something like this for people who have some familiarity, but are pretty eager to learn more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we want to get the experience to be as kind of slick and exciting to people as and seamless as what you expect on an Apple Pay, or the Google Wallet. So when you sign transactions, you just tap the fingerprint scanner, and it automatically detects your fingerprint, does a biometric checking inside trusts out in a secure environment, and that signature happens and your transactions go through. The nice thing about doing this in Solana is that it's cheap and fast and it feels like you're using, you know, Google Wallet or Apple Pay as well. So you're own experience is kind of a slow network effect that you do on a theory or other networks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut there's more. I think one of the fundamental reasons why this is necessary isn't just the security part, it’s actually the applications part of the web3 DAP store that Solana released as well. There's a bit of a fundamental difference with web3 business models, that doesn't really work with web2. When you own web3 content, you actually own it. You own those NFTsYou know, when you own music that you bought from iTunes, you don't actually own that music. It's still Apple, so you can't transfer it. You can't sell it on eBay, right? You can't give it to your kids, in theory. But then NFTs, you can actually own those digital goods. So that just doesn't really quite work with the App Store models, like applications, like magic eaten in their iOS app, they can't list the digital items that are for sale in their marketplace, at 30%. higher price in the iOS App Store because they don't own that content. They can't eat those costs internally. And they can't list it higher because there's no way somebody's gonna pay $30,000 for an NFT in the Apple App Store, if it's available for 10,000 bucks on the desktop, that's just never gonna work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo there's a bit of a conundrum there. How do we get the app the big app stores to change those policies and to actually re-script to let these new business models, you know, be discovered and for people to figure out how to monetize them in a way that's fair to everyone. So I think we're taking that first step to really enable that for consumers and developers to see what happens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnatoly, was it always part of your your calculus or your dream to have a separate Solana App Store, especially given how the App Stores of today, Googles and Apples have very strict payment system rules and to your point, one of the big headaches for developers, of course, is this 30% figure and a lot of the rules and regulations under the companies that basically control the market share of the space, at least up until now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, you know, Solana is a platform. It's a platform for developers. So I talked to developers all the time, it's just kind of my day to day, probably half of my day is spent talking to external developers that are building some applications. And I would say their number one concern is how am I going to get these web3 features through the Google approval process for the Apple approval process? So as soon as we started gaining traction with devs, this was always something that they brought up. So immediately it became something that I've kind of always had in the back of my mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDo you expect web2 companies to try and do something like this? You did a good job a response or two or go laying out some of their challenges, but is it your expectation that even the web2 kind of legacy names will be forced to sort of adapt?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would love to work with every web tech company that's thinking about this, and with all the tech we built is open source, we will gladly work with them to do the engineering work for them to start leveraging this platform. That would be awesome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHave you, if you don't mind me asking, have you had any conversations with any of those names?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNothing deep that we want to announce yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay. All right. Fair enough. I'm a journalist. I'm just asking the questions I'm sure you understand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, give me your sense. Give me your sense about why this has not yet been done already and why is Solana the right foundation for mobile, and of course your for more mainstream adoption?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mean, it's probably because I'm the founder that worked at Qualcomm for over a decade. So I knew exactly what pieces of technology we needed to build to ship this. So it didn't take a 100 person team. It was a very small team of labs, you know, I think about five to seven engineers that we got the ball rolling to get this out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd Solana the network is really well suited for the mobile experience, users really can't wait, you know, 10, 20, 30 seconds, let alone minutes for transactions to settle. That has to happen within one to two seconds, and it has to be so cheap that for the mobile experience, developers can actually pay for the user.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo if the unit economics for using these web3 applications have to be so low that you can start doing the same kind of adoption, you know, product market fit loops that you see on mobile applications today. And that means users don't actually care about what network it’s running in- they don't deal with gas costs. And all that stuff is kind of hidden behind the scenes for them. And for that to be possible, the network has to be cheap, as fast as to be scalable. I think Solana is the only one that really fits that bill right now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAny close competitors you have who might launch a competing phone or something like that, not even on your radar just yet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's not even on my radar. Anonymously, everything we built is open source. I think we would love to get contributions from anyone on the Ethereum community or Bitcoin community to add support for those networks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhenever you talk about mobile pay operations, this opens the doors to a conversation for general security questions, security concerns. Talk to me about the assurances, and really the work that you and your team have had to do with regards to privacy considerations, especially for any person out there who might consider getting involved, but say, hey, when it comes to mobile pay operations, you're really dealing with some pretty intimate personal information.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as everybody knows, public permissionless networks are public by default. So any transactions that you do are recorded in a public ledger. So this is something that folks need to be mindful of. And there are technologies to make transactions more private, like elusive is a technology that does as your knowledge proof when you want to do transfers and things like that. So you would have to intentionally use those technologies. And because all of those are available as smart contracts, it is really outside of the hardware wallets kind of domain to take care of the wallet, the only thing that it provides is the secure signing capability. But everything else you can basically access via smart contracts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow many pre orders do you have on the phone? What does interest look like?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBefore we launched, we had about I think 5,000 pre orders, we were targeting developers and from my perspective, it was..our DBT units that we shipped are very well received. So we have a very excited developer community that loves the device.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo it sounds like that was largely your expectation about that 5,000 number. And again, keep in mind, it's early, right? We're not even quite yet at the shipping distribution phase of it, but you get the sense that that largely matches the excitement you had hoped for for people?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, so the thing is that like, I've worked on every major phone launch at Qualcomm, like as an engineer, remember the Amazon Fire the Metro phone from Microsoft. It's very, very hard to launch a phone with a million units sold on day one. And this is actually I think ..this was never our time, when you look at daily active users on\u0026nbsp; the most popular web3, networks like applications like OpenSea, it's about 10 to 20,000 people that generate 20 to $30 million of volume per day. So our goal is to actually get the most heavy web3 users on this device. And because there's no restrictions for web3 content on this device, that's a better distribution channel. If you can target those 10 to 20,000 users directly as an app developer, that's a much better distribution channel than the big app stores because of the restrictions. So that's really what matters. Can we get the right users?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd how about targeting users that may not yet be too involved with the web3 space? I think at this point, most people, if not everyone has heard of it. But as you know, not everyone has necessarily felt confident as of yet to dip their toe into the market. You do a great job laying out the case, I would argue in terms of going to that core constituency that you know, we'll be supportive. I think your pre-order numbers suggest that, but how about other people that are sort of on the sidelines? Is this something they might be able to consider, if not now, for potential future application?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is an awesome Android device on its own. It's built by an amazing company, the founder literally designed the iPad Pro. I mean, like when I worked at Qualcomm, and I would compare the phones that we had to iPhones and I was always like, why can't we have nice things. This is like the first phone that I feel like the build quality is better than Apple’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I would suggest that anyone that's like, loves phones and wants to check out Android, we've literally I think the first time that I've ever seen people tweet on Twitter, I'm going to switch from iPhone to an Android device because of this. So I would genuinely recommend that people go check it out simply because it's an awesome phone. And then maybe if they're curious about crypto, check out those features too.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnything like this is undoubtedly a huge labor of love. Talk to me personally, what most excites you? I can only imagine here, right, but just covering enterprise and covering big companies, and covering people with big ideas for a living. There's such an emotional part about this. It's such a deeply personal thing you and your colleagues are undoubtedly pouring all of yourselves into this. What most excites you personally about this, that you would want someone watching this interview to take away?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOh, man, yeah, we literally call it chewing glass. But the process of launching a product like this, we had to chew a lot of glass. What I love about it is I think all the ideas that we have, and all the dreams that we have about having this like full web3 adoption with privacy, and people with self custody, having full control of their funds, of their digital content, it's all kind of coming together. And it’s all.. the technology is there. It's possible, and the user experiences can be wonderful. It could be joyful, right? You're using Apple Pay or any other Google Wallet experiences, but now for crypto.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that to me is really, really exciting. And I want to see people that are so excited about the applications that this is the best reason that they get this phone. They're not just curious, but they actually see somebody that built something that gives them so much value that they want to go get this phone and then enjoy that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mean, you work in this space, you're on Twitter as much as I am, if not more - so you know, web3 has its fair share of critics. What do you say to people that may still be on the outside and not they're not on the outside, because they just haven't learned enough to get involved, they're on the outside because they have learned a lot and they are firmly in the camp of being adversarial to a lot of the efforts that you're describing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think their skepticism is very warranted and welcome. And I think it's going to take a lot of work for us to prove that there is real value here. And I think that's very fair to say, like we haven't yet seen an application and crypto in web3, that has broken out to consumer success that everyone's using it on a day to day basis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we're trying to kind of like remove all the speed bumps for developers to get there. And that's a lot of work in and of itself. But I firmly believe in the idea of self custody, that you own these cryptographic keys that are secured with math, and that gives you tremendous power to transact and coordinate with people online. It's a very powerful thing – it expands to human human rights, right? That's maybe a bit too much. There's much bigger problems in the world, but it does empower people to go do really cool things on the internet, so I think that's awesome and I'm excited to see the kinds of applications people build.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then talk to me a bit more about especially for people that are kind of accustomed to having a more traditional provider, let's say an AT\u0026amp;T or Verizon - what does this look like specifically with Helium 5G? First, a lot of mobile, especially if you're introducing some names that some people, not all of your demographic base, of course, but some people are only really learning about for the first time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I mean, if you're a wireless network nerd, this has got to be the coolest thing ever. Because, you know, all these massive networks, they're effectively almost like government mandated monopolies. These are very big companies. They require licensing from the FCC and a lot of work and deployment to go build, build these towers and deploy these towers and everything. And Helium is doing it from the ground up, basically volunteer driven, and people are doing it for tokens, which are like, you know, more or less doing it for fun, right? They want to see if this will actually work. And I believe Helium was at about 8,000 5G cells, and these are like four GCB, you know, 4G+ CBRS spectrum band cells, similar to what other folks call 5G as well. If you want to get technical, there's a bunch of differences, but it's a high quality network at like 8,000 cells. AT\u0026amp;T and Verizon, I think are about 50,000 cells.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe United States probably needs like a million. These are the estimates that I've seen before people talk about online. Some will say as high as 10 million to really get wall to wall coverage. So there's a lot of work left to do for the big carriers. And I think there's a very good chance that Helium passes them. And like overtakes and is maybe the first one to actually get to that, you know, 500,000 or a million number of like 5G cells in the United States. And that would be awesome. That means a bunch of volunteers coordinating with cryptography, right? Just with a bunch of math on a public blockchain, we're able to outpace in very critical infrastructure for United States for communication. I think that would be the coolest thing that's ever happened, I think in technology.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou told me earlier about the number of pre orders. Are you able to give me a sense about your own internal projections? How many of these are you hoping to sell? And what does that kind of long term base case look like?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would be super happy if we get 25,000 hardcore users that love this device. To me that's like, that's something that I know, developers that I talked to, would find very compelling as a distribution channel. And that's a good enough start. Obviously, it would be amazing if we were 10x that. And that would be awesome, but we'll see what happens. It's very hard to build phones, we build a really great device. But you know, it's very, very hard to sell phones. It's a very competitive market. So we'll see what happens. Startups are here to take big swings and take risk. That's what we're doing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, my man, you got to take big swings, you're swinging for the fences out there. If it were easy to develop a phone, truly everyone would do it, and there's a reason so few are. Finally, what would you most want either anything we didn't directly talk about or anything that kind of keeps you up that you would most want people to know about this new iteration for you and the company?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is a work of love from Solana labs, and another startup Awesome Privacy, that have really poured their heart into the hardware and the software. I really want people to go check it out and really just go see if they can enjoy the experiences that we've built for them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko is the co-founder of Solana and the CEO of Solana labs.

I'm your host Connor Round and I'm so happy to be here with you today to discuss the key themes in AI and the industries that it can bring innovation and growth to. I'm thrilled to welcome my guest today, Ivana Delevska, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Spear Invest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks for having me, Connor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to start off, you know, we're here to talk about artificial intelligence. It's an opportunity that has use cases beyond the human imagination. So just to start off when considering business applications of AI, could you help investors understand what industries and sectors you see greatly benefit from the innovations in the space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sounds great. Connor so many people under appreciate the fact that AI today is already a $100 billion industry and it's still in the very early innings. The main applications that we see it used in today would be for consumer technologies. So it would be for like recommenders in cases like TikTok or e-commerce where you're getting recommended products to buy. So that's one of the largest applications that we see today. But looking forward, we think AI will be transformational for many industries, traditionally industrials, automotive, life sciences. We think it's really going to have a transformative impact for the broader industrial complex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVery interesting. And could you just break down the AI capabilities that you see within the social media space?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, yeah, so it's interesting social media. Previously, all of the innovation or all of the use cases in AI were based on this recommender model. So basically, companies like TikTok would in-house train their their models to be able to tell based on few data points on videos that you watch, they're going to be able to form a whole profile about you, and then be able to, to recommend you other videos, and they can be really addictive as most people, most people have seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's kind of the main use case today. Now, the new thing in AI is this transformer model, which was the concept or the paper was written and introduced in 2016. But you've really seen these models just getting trained, these large language models. So Chat GPT, is one application of this large language model, it's based on a model called GPT 3 that was introduced in 2021. So a lot of people are excited about the applications of Chat GPT today, but I will highlight that this is just one kind of flavor of the opportunity that we see going forward.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, I'm actually happy you brought up chat GPT that was just gonna go right into that. Apart from it kind of just expanding and, you know, breaking out into the scene very quickly. How do you see other companies reacting in the space? Do you see Google coming out with a new search engine capability? I'd love to hear your opinion on that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so we see Microsoft and Google, as potentially being leaders on the language side, Microsoft has maybe a head start, they've invested quite a bit here. And we've seen quite a lot from them. They're behind the GPT 3 language model, but they also recently announced an even newer model with even more parameters, 530 billion parameters, so we're gonna see a lot more from them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGoogle has been pretty quiet. They were maybe the leader several years ago. So we are waiting to hear what's going to come out of them. Investors believe that they have something, but it's kind of TBD. So as of right now, those are the two that are going to be leaders in the lead on the language model side. But it's very important for investors to realize that when you invest, you don't necessarily just want the direct beneficiary over trend, there is going to be a lot of investment in the infrastructure beyond behind like, behind AI. So for Microsoft, it's not just on the Bing side that they can introduce Chat GPT and kind of help jumpstart their business, but they're really going to benefit on the cloud side as well. So from an investment perspective, right now, we're finding better risk rewards in investing in the infrastructure. So it would be semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity as well. So yeah, so basically, the point here is beware of value traps, right? You don't want to invest in something that will get competed away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. And just to keep on Chat GPT, a lot of the hype has brought excitement to firms. And it kind of seems to be a similar trend to that of the crypto boom in 2021, with BuzzFeed announcing Chat GPT similar implications. Just wanted to know, do you see this as maybe a trend that will die down? Or is this something that we can expect to last?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell ChatGPT specifically, what you will need to see is people building things that are going to be useful on it. So specifically, for us, we're looking for maybe broader opportunities than that. But AI is a trend that is definitely not going to die down. As I mentioned before, it's already a $100 billion dollar industry. So whether Chat GPT takes off or not, it’s not really going to have..it will have some implications on AI but it's not really going to have broad implications for AI, if that makes sense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDefinitely and as you said, it is a $100 billion industry already. But in order to rev up innovation in this space further, much hardware and infrastructure will be required, such as the need for, you know, the much reliance semiconductor industry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat types of semiconductors, so we could just help investors understand, are required for building out AI, and how much of the industry is dedicated to its face?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, so, so thanks for asking that question, Connor. So basically, in order to train these models, you need GPUs. And that's why companies like Nvidia produce these today. And basically GPUs allow computers to do parallel operations and the reason why people are all of a sudden so excited about AI versus say a year or two ago is that prior to the transformer model, and prior to this language, first language models, trained AI will just be able to do prescriptive tasks. So, if you give it a bunch of images, it can learn what you're showing it, right? So it wouldn't necessarily be able to put things into context or draw its own conclusions. So in order to be able to put things into context and draw its own conclusions, the model sizes have increased exponentially. So maybe five years ago, in 2018, the model sizes would have been less than 100 million parameters. Today, these models that are trained and deployed are over over 500 billion parameters. So the amount of GPUs that are required for this is exponential.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, and what players in the space do you see benefiting from increased demand for AI related chips such as GPUs?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e So in video is gonna be a big beneficiary full disclosure, we all not only video stock, and we disclose all of our holdings on our website, but then you may be able to see the reason why Nvidia is such a beneficiary is because they came up with this CUDA architecture that is free for people to use. So if you want to build something on AI, all you need to do is buy the NVIDIA hardware, and then you can use these frameworks for free. Other companies are not there yet. So you could still buy GPUs from AMD. But then what do you do with them? But over time, as the industry develops, there is likely going to be other solutions, and maybe some of these other companies that are developing GPUs will benefit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area we really like that is not doing very well right now, is cloud infrastructure. So a lot of the cloud names are getting hit pretty hard, because of enterprise spending cuts. So this is a sector that hasn't really done that well in this recent bounce, this year. Nvidia is already up quite a bit here today, but the cloud cloud names have really not performed in line, so we like that. And then as you deploy AI, you're going to have a lot more vulnerabilities so you're going to need newer cybersecurity solutions. So this is another area where we find a lot of opportunities – basically how do you secure? How do you secure these AI workloads? And how do you secure eight edge computing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, so a lot of industries that are going to see some upside there and those segments, but the industry has struggled with keeping up with shift demand through supply chain constraints, severely dealing with shortages throughout the years of 2021 and 2022. If AI demand gears up in the near future, will semiconductor firms be able to manage their supply chains to keep up with demand trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we see a lot of supply actually getting added over the next two to three years. So we think there is going to be plenty of supply of chips available. And just to explain how this works, basically companies like Nvidia and AMD, they don't manufacture the chips, but they just design them and then foundries like TSMC will do the actual manufacturing. So we're seeing - this is a pretty big trend actually that's supporting even broader economic activity in the U.S. are these large CapEx investments by the foundries or the large chip manufacturers like TSMC. Intel as well has expansion plans. So there's going to be plenty of supply, we believe to meet the demand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat And just lastly, could you just break down the traditional segments of the semiconductor space? What spaces or segments do you see slowing down? And are there any other ones that you see an opportunity, and I know that you named a few, but if you just break them down for investors to understand a little bit more, I think that'd be fantastic. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. So basically the big separation is between consumer and data center. So, if you look at, for example, TSMC, revenues would be like half consumer, like a very high level, half consumer half data center. So consumer would be used in PCs, smartphones, and then on the data center side, this would be like cloud, cloud vendors, and in any sort of enterprise computing. And then within the data center segment, we're seeing slowdown across the board. So the consumer got pretty hard hit at the beginning of last year, PC demand has been significantly down but the way semis work is usually there is a lot of inventory in the system. So what the manufacturers or designers see is a lot worse than what in demand looks like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as inventory stabilizes, TSMC said that they're expecting it to stabilize at the beginning of this year, and to see pick up in the second half of next year. And then similarly, on the data center side, that segment just started seeing some weakness, but we believe that the high performance computing, which is what we talked about with Nvidia, like the chips that are required for AI, we expect those will hold up better.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat.

Happy Wednesday and welcome once again to Views from Space where we dive into the space economy and where it's headed. This is part of a monthly series presented by Terran Orbital, a manufacturer of small satellites.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm your host Kinsey Grant, and I am so excited to dive into our topics today, as the live title will suggest we have some big ones coming up Deep Space, Mars, Milani, all sorts of great new tech that we're going to be talking about today with our fantastic guests who I'm going to introduce right now. We have Margarita Cardi who is the VP of Programs at Tyvak International, which is the International segment of Terran Orbital, and also with us Franco Perez Lissi, the systems engineer at the European Space Agency. Franco, Margherita, welcome to Public Live. I'm so excited to have you here with us today. How are you doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGood afternoon. All good. How are you doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e: Hi, everybody - Margherita here.\u0026nbsp; Thanks for the invite and it’s evening here but good afternoon to you guys.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, isn't that funny how that works. I'm actually in Los Angeles right now so it's morning here, evening there but you know what? Space – there’s never a bad time to talk about it. So let's dive in. Are you guys ready to get to some big questions today?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, let's go. Right.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll right, great. So I want to start here, with getting a better understanding of what we're going to talk about today, setting the groundwork, and understanding the important context. Space as a topic is I would say often rife with a lot of mystique and, and a lot of fascination that goes along with that. Now in your work developing small satellites Margherita, you are working to make space more accessible and especially when we're talking about making space more accessible, we're talking about deep space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo for our listeners, knowing that this is part of space that's well beyond the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis on the area beyond the Earth Moon system, I would love it if you could just walk our audience through a quick rundown of what you think makes deep space so appealing. And I think appealing in a lot of ways, you know, appealing from just a general interest standpoint, but also appealing as a satellite developer or for a scientific researcher, what makes deep space so interesting to you, Margherita?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, thanks for the question. It is a very nice one. And I have to say that, at the moment, let's say, we are pretty, you know, conscious about the Earth orbit so the Leo and the orbit around Earth, are environments that are quite well known, I would say, at this moment, while the deep space environment is kind of unexplored, or, let's say less explored, this makes this you know, fascinating for the human being in general. And, and of course, the other aspect that I love about this environment is that we are targeting, you know, bodies, planets, asteroids, on whatever that are not really known in terms of structure and also visual impact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the fact is that even if we have some very good assets on the ground that can, you know, do amazing pictures and amazing inspection of some bodies, just when you just get close to that you can really understand what it looks like, in reality. And so this is something that is really fascinating for me personally, but I think that is the driver, you know, for all the people working in the space environment and targeting, you know, the deep space. So there's a, you know, very far away environment with bodies that we really don't don't know yet. And so even in our mission, which we will go to dive a little bit in detail, we are going to a body that we don't really know about, right? So that's the mystery of discovering something new and, and we don't know what to expect. So with that there is like the mystery of that which is driving our, our work and our let's say the way to do satellites to explore this kind of environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. Yeah. Really interesting. And I think that your focus here on trying to know the unknown is certainly going to be a recurring theme that I'm sure we encounter today as we talk Talk about deep space. Franco, I'm curious if you have anything to add about why you think deep space is so interesting and so attractive and intriguing for both people who are just interested in space and also for the Science and Technology communities?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, sure. So thanks very much. Similar to Margherita, I think I had always the interest and ambition to go beyond Earth since we know little about it, which makes it more appealing. And I think the amount of science and technology demonstration potential on this planetary bodies is very large. So we're going beyond Earth, in many cases to study planets or objects of our solar system that could also explain the origin of our universe, and that's making it super cool.\u0026nbsp; I mean, by investigating Mars, we can extract information about how the Earth was or how it will be millions of years. So for instance, we studied the core of asteroids as the one things we’re going to do on our mission, and we could understand the millions of millions of years of history before our universe. So for the mission that we're working on, we're going into deep space with a different objective, we're going there to support the protection of our Earth in case of a closer encounter with a potentially dangerous asteroid. So in this situation, hypothetical by now, we need to deviate the trajectory of an asteroid way before it arrives, two years before. We need to go as far as possible to avoid collision with earth and study these bodies in detail, of course, to get all the tools required. So for me there are planetary defense technology, and scientific interests ongoing. So it's a little bit of a combination.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's really interesting to consider how understanding our past and our origins might help us to be better equipped to handle whatever comes in the future. I find that to just be endlessly fascinating. Now, with both of these answers in mind, I would love it if the two of you could explain a little bit how satellites come into play here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what are some of the use cases for satellites navigating deep space? And I think this would be a great time to talk about some of the focus areas that both of you have and the work that you're doing within the satellite ecosystem. So tell me a little bit about how satellites play into our strategy for exploring deep space – and both of you can feel free to chime in here and share whatever comes to mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMargherita, would you like to kick us off?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sure. So coming to the, let's say, the technology area, of course, as I was saying before\u0026nbsp; the space is kind of a different environment with respect to the Earth orbits, and there are a few things that I would like to stress and to focus on a little bit because these environmental impacts on the design of the spacecraft for a few things, which are crucial. So for the first place, I would say that the radiation environment is different. So let's say in the, in the Deep Space, and in general, out of the atmosphere, there is a radiative environment, which is very peculiar, and it's different with respect to you know, the distance from Earth and from the sun, etc. And so, in the Milan emission, for example, and in the asteroid environment, we have a very peculiar environment, and we have to make sure that our technology, and our systems are able to survive this kind of environment. So, of course, there are some methods in order to ensure that and we are executing an extensive edition campaign on some of the crucial modules of the spacecraft so that we can, you know, try to reproduce on Earth what we will be seeing during the mission. It's not, let's say possible to have a match one to one, but in general, we can have some models that allow us to replicate the environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, thanks to this test, we are able to understand how the systems are responding to the relative environment and so, to be able to implement any mitigation action that we can actually implement on ground before the mission. So, I would say that ideation is one of the main topics that we are focusing on on Milani as well as the navigation because again, we are not in the Earth orbit. So we cannot rely on, you know, existing assets such as the GPS, for example. So, we have to rely on different methods of navigation with which combined to the distance from the Earth. It makes the world aggregation approach pretty peculiar and complex, I would say. So, we have to implement systems that allow us to navigate in such a far and unknown environment and this is kind of something that is putting challenges in our development.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd in this particular mission, in addition to that, the results are another constraint that We have to consider is that the Milani satellite that we are developing as part of the head of mission will not have the capability to directly communicate with Earth. So, we have to rely on the Hara mothercraft for the communication. So, there is a so-called inter-satellite link system that is allowing Milani and Hara to communicate. And then Hara will be, you know, the main bridge to Earth to download the data and the scientific measurements. So, I would say these three things, at least from the Milani point of view, and then we will see what Frank was saying about the overall mission. But these three challenges are the ones that at the moment are really, you know, adding challenges and pushing the development to a more extreme, let's say level, I would say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight, right. I imagine that that tremendously complicates things. And I would love to dig in a little bit more to this Milani mission, the Milani CubeSat mission. Franco, if you don't mind, could you tell us a little bit about the purpose of the mission? What are the scientific objectives for the Milani mission?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, for sure. So, the main scientific objectives of the mission are mainly related to characterize the binary asteroid surface of Deimos, you see now a hyperspectral camera on board a CubeSat. So, the size objectives are split in three. So, the first one is to map the composition of the Deimos, just to understand, which is the content inside the asteroid to be able to respond. As I said before, if an asteroid is coming to the earth, we need to hit it, we need to change the trajectory. So we need to understand first, the materials and what we're finding when we get there, that is determining the mineral composition difference between the two objects.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mentioned that this is a binary asteroid, a binary means that probably there is a main body and then there is a small asteroid orbiting around the main body as a moon. So we need to determine if there are differences in mineral composition. And also determine the surface roughness and regolith grain size, what we call the surface made out of boulders, it's compact material, etc. So that will give us a good understanding of how strong we need to hit the Astro, for instance, to change the trajectory, and so on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo mainly you are familiar with the dark mission that our mission was a NASA mission that was launched a few months ago, and also a few months ago, it impacted the moon. So this mission was demonstrating the first step of the whole space safety program, which was hitting the asteroid and now characterizing what is the aftermath of this technology, right? So this is when Milani will come into play. So basically Milani, once we arrive with the main spacecraft, Milani will be deployed in the asteroid vicinity, we will be flying around the asteroid and take your images in different spectral ranges to understand all these objectives that we mentioned before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it really is fascinating stuff and I appreciate all the context here and explaining the, you know, real world real life use cases for all this that’s happening. I know that for a lot of people out there, myself included, it can be difficult to completely understand the scope of some of these projects that are happening in deep space. So I appreciate the attention to detail and helping me understand them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow, I would love to transition here for a minute to talk about the big picture relationships that make all this happen. We were talking here about the Milani mission, this is a collaboration between your two organizations. And I understand that for much of our modern history, when it comes to space exploration, we hear about competing ambitions from different nations, you know, it's one nation trying to beat another to a certain space milestone. But I understand now that it comes down to a lot more collaboration than that when we're talking about real space exploration and real, you know, major innovation in space, in deep space. So tell me a little bit about how that has worked, you know, this collaboration between Tyvak and with the ESA, tell me how these relationships have evolved to be a little bit more global, as we tried to navigate what comes next and what we need to do next when it pertains to deep space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, I can start answering the question, if you don't mind. So, from my perspective, I have to say that I need to take a little step back in the sense that in Europe, let's say in the last, I would say 10 or 20 years, I'd say that the space environment has been evolving a lot. So historically, there were you know, big space companies, which were you know, getting the majority of the industry at the end on the market and say in the last decades, these small companies, let's say small space companies started to grow, and to have the place, you know, in Europe and and now we can demonstrate that also the medium company as we are, can really do a lot of things for the Europe and for the European Space Agency in general. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe example of Tyvak International is pretty useful to understand this trend, because we were born in 2016 and we were just, you know, three or four employees and now we count 50 people and we grew organically in the European ecosystem I would say of companies, and all our employees are from Europe. Actually, most of them are Italian at the end. And our supply chain is mostly European and Italian. And so we are actually bringing value to the European ecosystem. And, this program demonstrates that, you know, small companies as we are can act as prime contractors. So for Milani, we act as the prime contractor for the European Space Agency, and so we had this amazing opportunity three years ago to start this very challenging project and for which I will never stop to thank ESA for this opportunity because now this is possible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd it's happening more and more in different projects and, of course, Italy, as always plays a good role, because of course, we have one of the main contributors to the space ecosystem in Europe. And again, working on this program and on other programs that we did in the past it’s challenging and it’s of course having a, you know, a very demanding customer. But I also found in the ESA team, you know, very pragmatic people very prepared, and so the collaboration between the two teams is amazing for this project in particular, I will never stop saying that, you know, the relationship and the collaboration and the pragmatic approach, when everything happens is is really is really awesome. I would say I have never seen something like that before and I'm pretty grateful for that, in this occasion. So that gives me the opportunity to thank again, ESA for that and saying that as my example, I mean, our example as a small company in Italy, working on these small satellites, you know, we demonstrated that we can do more, and we will be growing in the in the future, let's say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, very, very interesting to hear that. And I think that you know, Margherita, it's very obvious and hearing that answer that collaboration is an enormous part of what both of your companies are doing or both of your organizations are doing. So I appreciate you sharing that. Now finally, to close out today, we'd like to do a little myth busting to talk about some of the biggest myths or misconceptions about space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd today we'll talk about Deep Space, particularly, but I'd love to ask both of you. Do you have any misconceptions about the space industry that you want to reset the narrative or set the record straight? Anything that you think people get wrong about space that you would like to set them right off? Franco, would love to kick off here with you anything you want.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, so I'm not sure if it misconceptions, but I think probably there are many aspects of Space Science or space technology that people tend to underestimate because probably they don't understand how complex they are. And I would like to focus on two probably two aspects. So the first one is the space environment. So Margherita was mentioning it before a little bit, but within the low earth orbit, when we are close to the Earth, we are protected by the magnetosphere which protects the Earth from high energy particles. Therefore the environment is more, let's say, adequate for satellites. But when we go beyond, and also that applies also for human spaceflight, so when when astronauts go beyond, things are starting to get a little bit more complex because we don't have that protection of the earth Magnetosphere, and we start interacting with particles that can hit our electronics, deposit a lot of energy and create like break the electronics or create overcurrent over voltages etc. So there is a large complexity in designing and mission that goes beyond, not only because we're going far from the earth and the communications are harder and so on, but also because of the environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the second topic that I would like to also highlight is people usually tend to underestimate the complexity of how hard it is to navigate in space. So we don't have GPS or we don't have our iPhones or Android phones with Google Maps there. But what we have is the stars, and we have the knowledge of our position in the universe so that what we call G and C is guidance, navigation and control of the spacecraft is one of the most complex disciplines. And it's amazing how we can actually help the NASA Dark mission there. So basically, we launch a rocket from the earth, and we can hit an object with an accuracy that is amazing. And that object is probably 200 Million (kilometers) away from Earth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that is something that I think people tend to underestimate and how complex it is to hit that target from 200 million kilometers away. So these two aspects for me are things that usually I get questions about. And I think Tyvak is doing an amazing job on both domains, so on the radiation on the environment, etc, designing a robust mission, but also on the guidance and navigation and control to navigate the cube sat around around the authoring system.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely and I appreciate you sharing that. Margherita, anything you would like to add here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaybe just a couple of more generic points, of course, I fully agree with what Franco said. And maybe something that also people tend to not really fully understand because they are not working on them on this domain is that, you know, space is useless, and there are a lot of problems on the earth so we are wasting money and time working on space missions. And, you know, this is this is, this is a common feeling for people that are not working on the domain. And I would say that, you know, that's not fully true. And in the sense that working on the space, as demonstrating to have a social return, you know, of investment and competencies and knowledge also for on more ground application, I would say.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo based on the different domains and applications, this is kind of something that is now demonstrated. So this is one of the topics that I encounter more and more when I deal with this kind of discussion, having dinner with friends that are not doing this job. And so this is one of the things that I keep stressing with these people that are more external to the space environment, and also that the space, you know, it's accessible to very few people. And it's something that is, again, not accessible. And, again, we spoke about that at the beginning of this half- hour together. But we demonstrated that this is not true anymore. And small satellites, more launchers have opened a big door to space to basically everyone. So I appreciate it's like a complex domain. But you know, the doors now are open to everybody. And so this was not like that 10s of years ago, but now, with the new space economy, this is starting to be a reality. And so everybody can really access space, if they want. So I will say these two topics are our most of the discussion that I have with, you know, people that are not working in this domain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, I appreciate that context, too. And I think that one of the big lessons or takeaways here that I've had from this conversation is understanding that so much of what is going on in deep space really can have implications and impacts on the way that we go about living here on Earth, and I think that that's really, really interesting.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo with that, I would love to thank both of you, Margherita and Franco for joining us today. Once again, Margherita is the VP of programs at Tyvak international Franco is a Systems Engineer at the European Space Agency. And I would love to thank you both for your time and for joining me here today. I learned so much.

An IPO expert weighs in on how the market for newly-public companies could play out in 2023.","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHello, everybody and welcome to Public Live. I'm your host Ann Berry. Last year in 2022 only 71 companies IPO’d or went public, much lower a comparison with the 2021 surge of new listings. Since IPOs tend to represent a growth investing opportunity and untested companies, market optimism can play a big role in how IPOs are timed and ultimately received by the market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFollowing the optimism of 2021 and the volatility of 2022, let's unpack what experts predict could be in store for the IPO market or Initial Public Offering market in 2023. Our guest today is Nick Einhorn the Vice President of Research at Renaissance Capital, which issues the dollar IPO ETF, the only ETF focusing exclusively on the U.S. IPO market. It does so by providing investors with access to U.S. listed newly public company stocks in one security. Nick, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks. Thanks for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick, great to have you. Let's jump right on in and just unpack some of the stats together. Last year 2022 had a historically low rate of IPOs, so 71, to be exact. And with anything, but especially when it comes to investing, context is key. So I'd love it if you could walk us in the community through some of the challenges that companies were seeing in 2022 and what changed relative to that peaky period of 2021.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight, so as you say, a lot depends on what happened in 2020, 2021. Really the surge we saw in the markets, but especially in high growth tech stocks, for example, other riskier stocks, riskier assets, how much excitement there was around those and those years, and that drove a lot of the boom of 2021 IPO issuance. We had almost 400 U.S. IPOs, which is the highest it's been since the internet bubble 2000. And then really, things have flipped or flipped around in 2022. Largely because performance started to drop off towards the end of 2022..or sorry, towards the end of 2021 for those high multiple stocks. A lot of the sectors that had surged during 2021 started to turn around, and really started falling throughout all of 2022 and some of that was fears about recessions, the Fed raising interest rates, the war in Ukraine certainly contributed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so there's kind of a perfect storm of stocks starting to fall. And the new issues that did come out in 2022 didn't perform well, and so that caused investors to lose interest in the IPO market or stay on the sidelines. And so, at the same time, companies were hesitant to come public in that kind of environment, so a lot of them put their plans on hold, and ended up sitting out the year. So that kind of really just led to, like you said, only around 70 IPOs, which is the lowest number we've seen in the 30 years we've been tracking the IPO market in the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you use that dreaded word bubble right to describe some of 2021 and some of the going public activity then. But when we look in 2022 and the companies that did make it out into the public market, were there any things that those companies had in common? Where were they from specific sectors or stages of maturity, or specific industries? Was there something that enabled those that did go public to make it through the process?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, a lot of them were more mature companies, so less risky than your typical IPO. For example, we saw some large spin offs. Corebridge, which was the spin off of the insurance company AIG, Mobileye, a spinoff from Intel, so businesses that were well known by investors already from being part of large public companies. So that was one area, we saw some strength in specific sectors like energy. Given that energy prices were strong last year, we did see a few energy IPOs come out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe continue to see biotech issuance just because those are companies that really are more than most companies, need the cash from an IPO to fund drug development. So some of those may have preferred to wait too, for a better environment that you needed the cash to fund their trials. And, yeah, where we really saw the biggest drop off was in, you know, traditional VC backed tech, internet companies, software companies, and then some of the large LBOs. I think we saw no private equity backed IPOs last year, which was a fairly astounding fact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe kind of saw the opposite,,some take privates, right, because instead of taking public companies private instead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. I mean, you know, those private equity investors will look to where the sentiment is. And it saw last year, certainly later in the year, especially as a buying opportunity, given all the stocks that had been had come down a lot in price. And so, you know, I'm sure they're hoping that they're going to start seeing improvement in the market soon as they can take those public again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick, it's so great to have some of the context that you've provided. Let's shift now to how you and your colleagues at Renaissance Capital are thinking about what's ahead for the IPO market this year in 2023. Do you think we're going to see a flat year relative to 2022? Up, down directionally where are you thinking we're heading?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo our view is that obviously a lot will depend on what happens in the broader markets. But our basic expectation is that things will improve from 2022. But it will be gradual over the course of the year. And we won't get back to kind of normal levels of issuance until late in the year. Certainly, if not, you know, and maybe not even until next year, but we're hoping kind of later this year. And a lot is going to depend again, if the, you know, we want to see the broader market stabilizing, hopefully, the recession fears cool a bit. And we do see kind of a little more, some of the investor confidence come back into some of the sectors that have been the most hurt during the downturn.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut one thing we've learned from historical study of the IPO market is that periods of slow issuance often tends to produce strong IPO returns. A little counterintuitively, but it's really just because in the slow periods, buyers have a lot of the same power. So, they can really set the price on new issuance and make sure that IPOs are coming out at attractive valuations with clean governance structures, the companies kind of need to give those incentives to buyers to appeal to them. So hopefully, that when we come, these come public, the returns are good. And that, you know, increases interest in the market from both issuers and investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think we did start to see a little bit of that in the last few months, for example, Mobileye, the Intel spinoff, came public late last year, traded quite well up 40% or so right now. We saw a small insurance company come public last week, that's up over 20%, I believe. So I think we're starting to see some of those green shoots. And I think it will kind of gradually happened over the course of this year that we'll see more of those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOne of the things that we saw Nick, and you opened with this was the death of the going public and the real harm, in terms of the reduction in the share prices of a lot of businesses, particularly in that tech and growth area, which did not have profitability. And we're projected to burn cash for quite a long time. Do you think there'll be appetite for those types of companies to go public this year?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think it will depend on the company. Certainly, I think we've seen a lot of those private companies have shifted their mindset from kind of growth at all costs, which may have been in 2020, 2021. So more of a focus on how do we get to profitability, or at least, you know, break even. I think for the right story, investors will be willing to consider companies with losses, but I think it's going to need to be a kind of compelling story. And then, I think kind of bigger than that is just a question about valuation. Because companies that did private rounds, you know, in the last several years, often did those at very high valuations. And so if they're trying to come public today, that valuation might not be available in the market anymore. And so they have to kind of decide, do they want to wait and hope that they can, you know, grow some more and that the market will improve? Or do they want to bite the bullet and just recognize that, you know, there's no sense in waiting forever, and that if you can come public at a multibillion dollar valuation, it's still, you know, there's still a benefit to that, even if it's not quite what you're looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so I think we have seen some of the private companies have taken those steps to reset expectations, for example, Instacart lowered its internal valuation several times last year, I think, from around 40 billion to in the 10 billion range. So they're clearly looking at, you know, the reality on the ground and saying, if we're going to if we're going to come public, that's going to be the valuation we're going to be able to get in this market.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eInstacart is one specific example. Nick, thanks for taking us there. Because I'd love to just go through with you a couple of other specific companies that might go public this year. Some that are rumored to be planning IPOs are also Stripe, Discord, Reddit, TikTok coming out of Bytedance, the parent company, Epic Games. Of these maybe others, are there any that you think are potentially more likely to IPO a better position to do so than others?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's always hard to say with specific companies. I do think that some of these have been rumored IPOs for a while now. And part of my feeling is that if they didn't want to come public in 2021, when the market was super hot, you know, I'm not convinced they're gonna want to come this year. But I think some of these might be certainly IPO candidates. I'm sure they're watching the markets and eyeing the environment. But there are a lot of names that we track and I think some of them, like Instacart, like I mentioned, is one that we think is decently likely to come this year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere's some specific areas like there's a few big semiconductor companies that have been talking about IPOs and that's been an interesting area for investors in recent years. Cybersecurity is an area that I think has gotten a lot of attention lately. And there are some candidates in there like Arctic Wolf Networks, Lacework, Net Scope. So those are some names that I think, you know, could be coming. We have had a few big filings in recent months, for example, Kenvue which is a Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson spin off of consumer products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOverall, there's just a lot of companies that are going to be monitoring the situation, and as things hopefully improve, I think some of them will, will kind of move forward with plans that they've been shelving for, you know, a year now or so.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk a bit more specifically, Nick, about what Renaissance Capital is focusing on. It’s the only ETF that's focused on tracking newly public companies. Could just define for us what newly Public means within what timeframe recently?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEssentially, it's designed to provide investors with exposure to a portfolio of the largest and most liquid, newly listed IPOs. And so we're looking at a time frame of three years, basically, from when a company enters the index to leaves it. I mean, kind of view that as you know, that's an area of stage of life, where companies might not be included in major indices yet. So really, if you want to get exposure to that side of the market, our ETF is a way to do that. And basically, we take the IPO market, we try to cut off at about 100 million deal size, and then only talk at the top 80% and serve the market. And so the rationale is to provide exposure to the most liquid names within the IPO space. So we're, as opposed to maybe some of the small issuers that are a little low liquidity. And yeah, so and again, so that's for U.S. listed IPOs, including foreign companies that may list in the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe way we think about it is, you know, most investors are going to own, you know, funds that give them exposure to the broad equity markets, maybe it's, you know, the S\u0026amp;P 500 or other indices. But the challenge with those is that those tend to hold very mature companies, especially the S\u0026amp;P or the Dow, obviously, but other ETFs as well will hold, tend to add companies several years after they list and in some cases, you know, many years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, when we look at the IPO market, we think that's not really being captured in traditional investment products, investment funds, just because those companies are usually not added to major indices early. So we look at that IPO ETF as a way to kind of complement an existing portfolio of other stocks to really get exposure to the whole IPO or to the sorry, to the whole equity markets, you need to have some exposure to IPOs. And certainly investors can do their homework and can look at individual offerings, and kind of assess the risks and rewards of those. And, you know, we certainly encourage that with some of our other products like our IPO Pro, which is a product designed to trap the IPO market for active investors. But for those who kind of don't want to be doing that work, frankly, the IPO ETF is kind of just a way to get exposure to the broader IPO market\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the index based approach, Nick, just walk us through the benefit of that. It’s a little bit taking the work out of it to your point, but what else should we be thinking about when we're looking at ETFs and the benefits of having an index based system?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eExactly. It's designed to be, you know, entirely rules-based. So it's very transparent. And again, you can look at our website and the documentation there. At our firm a lot of our business is looking, you know, doing active fundamental research on IPOs for our institutional clients. And so there's certainly, you know, we certainly value the benefit of doing research on individual IPOs. But for a broad portfolio, we think that that kind of rules based approach, we're really capturing the whole IPO market in a way that we think makes sense and we're waiting based on floats or kind of capturing the liquidity of the market, we think that makes sense for investors who just want exposure to the broad IPO market.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick Einhorn, VP of Research at Renaissance Capital. I want to thank you so much for joining and for offering us here at the Public community your time today.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eHello, everybody. Welcome to Public Live, where we explore the latest trends in business and innovation. I'm your host Ann Barry and thrilled to join you right now. Today's guest is Kayvon Mohajer, Co-founder and CEO of SoundHound, which you guys can find under the ticker S-O-U-N. SoundHound is a voice artificial intelligence platform that helps smart devices, TVs, cars, and restaurants deliver conversational AI experiences to their customers. Kayvon it is such a pleasure to welcome you to Public Live. Thanks for joining.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you for having me!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, well, let's tee this up by talking about the fact that the concept of artificial intelligence, or AI, is something that has been getting a lot of attention, particularly recently with the breakout success of open AI, chat GPT, which is something we've talked about a lot here on Public Life. We can touch on that later in the discussion if you'd like. But before we dig into artificial intelligence in general, would you mind just giving listeners a little bit of background on Soundhound and what the business does?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I started three companies in undergrad and but after I graduated, I decided that I wanted to be a technical founder of a super high-tech company that would make a big impact in the world. So I went to Stanford University, and I got my Ph.D. in electrical engineering. And as I was looking for that, what would that next big change would be? I turned to science fiction, and in particular, Star Trek; I said, what do they have in stock? We don't have obvious answers like spaceships that go faster than light and teleportation and holodecks and replicators. But the one that was less obvious was voice AI. So the ability to talk to computers and robots and devices and rooms and have a natural conversation with them and ask them to do things and ask them to answer questions. And I thought that's something that would happen, for sure. And in my lifetime, and without conclusion, I started working from a dorm room at Stanford with my co-founders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Because science fiction does tend to become science fact over time. Right. That's, that's the old adage. So fast forward to today. Kayvon, you're out of your Stanford dorm. Talk to us about how the market for voice AI has evolved and what exactly SoundHound is doing. What does the product actually deliver?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eWe spent the first 10 years in stealth, so we kept to the secret. And we wanted to own the technology and make it better than anything else that was out there, and it took 10 years. But we finally achieved that milestone, and we unveiled it a few years ago. And today, we are one of the few companies that completely owns the full stack of voice AI and conversational AI in-house. So there are a lot of players. But most of those use a platform like ours. And we are one of the very few technology providers. And one of the unique attributes of SoundHound is that we aim really high. And we solve super complex problems that push the boundaries of what is possible. For example, what others are trying to do is they want to make computers catch up to humans in language understanding. But our goal is to make computers better than humans so they can do things that humans cannot do. And we are able to support really complex conversations. And that can make people more productive and make the world a better place. And I'll give you an example. Let's say you are looking for a restaurant and you had Chinese food yesterday. So you don't want Chinese food today. You still don't ask a personal assistant to show me restaurants except for Chinese because you don't think they will work. You kind of have learned the boundaries of where they fail and you just operate in that boundary. You ask them simple questions based on keywords. And if you do ask them to show me restaurants except for Chinese, they all say here are some Chinese restaurants where they actually give you the opposite of what you want. But without technology, you can say here's an example actually works. Today Show me Asian restaurants in San Francisco, excluding Chinese and Japanese, and only show the ones that have more than three stars and are open after 9 pm On Wednesday, and you get exactly what you want. Then you can follow up and refine it, and you have a conversation in a complex conversation. So most of our customers choose us because of our superior tech. But they also choose us because you're an independent provider of voice AI. So we don't hijack their brand, product, user, and data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eSo Keyvan, give us a really specific example of that, to bring this to life for the community. So you just gave the example where voice AI was effectively being used for search, right, that you are articulating, I want to find a restaurant with this cuisine in this area. In that example, who is your client? Is it the search engine is that the restaurant and into what device or into what platform is the user speaking to get that search result?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo we power devices and services. So with our cars, TVs, IoT devices, appliances, and those are the endpoints to interact with, you know, these domains. And then we also power services. So, for example, for restaurants. When was the last time you call the restaurant to place an order and you had a good experience, they usually don't pick up the phone. And when they pick up the phone, they are very distracted; it's noise in the background, and they are serving people walking in. And our solution addresses that problem. We take over their phone line; we always pick up the phone so you don't miss restaurants don't miss on any calls. And we give a really good experience for every user. We take their orders, we answer their questions, upsell people and give them recommendations. So we power products and services. And we have this ecosystem vision where we bring them together. So the services that we've voice-enabled now can be accessed by the users of products like you're driving your car, you can order food, you can book appointments, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berr: \u003c/strong\u003eGot it. I mentioned at the beginning that you do service smart devices; you've repeated them: TVs, autos, and restaurants came on to give us a sense of how big your addressable market is, how far you've penetrated it, and how much room there is left to run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThe voice AI category in the stock market is estimated to become 160 billion. And if you include search and monetization, you know that search is today keyword based. And Google makes a lot of money for keyword-based because people search with keywords advertisers bid on those keywords. If you include the concept that the next generation of searches conversational AI and comes from advertising, it will be much bigger than that. And there are very few providers because of the high barrier to entry. And today, we powered millions of products. The power of Vizio TVs, for example, they're the second-largest TV maker in the US. Just in the last few years, we have 17 car brands have chosen SoundHound, which is very impressive. And beyond TV and automotive, the power products like Snapchat, and Pandora, we work for companies like Netflix and MasterCard to become a robust IoT (Internet of Things) devices. We announced a strategic partnership with Qualcomm to integrate voice AI into their Snapdragon chipsets and the new Italian service fee analysis that sounds for restaurants that I just talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat overview. It's incredible to hear just how far SoundHoud has come from that 10 years and stealth to now having a public company out there and in full visibility. Let's talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within Voice AI. Can you talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within voice? Can you talk about whether you've seen the market for voice AI tech become a bit more crowded and how SoundHound has kept its edge and a competitive advantage?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I usually, so there are a lot of players in voice because Voice AI is happening, and people are adopting it, and there's a big demand for it. But there's a high barrier to entry. So the core technology providers in voice AI, I will say, a handful at a global scale. I usually say it takes 10 years to create voice AI technologies. And it takes three years to realize it will take 10 years, so I've seen several companies with resources start on the pack and then abandon it. So there's a really high barrier to entry, and as a platinum provider in multiple languages in multiple regions, multiple industries. Soundhound is very unique. So we support about 25 languages. We support multiple industries. We are in Asia; we are in Europe, we are in North America and South America, and we claim to be the best tech. And again a lot of customers are to choose us mainly for the quality of the tech. And the fact that you're independent and we don't hijack their brand and users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCould you talk a little bit cable and about how voice AI benefits consumers now and maybe in the future, and just what are some of the more surprising applications that, you know, the average person doesn't really know about yet? What are the hidden nuggets of the use cases that you've seen in your experience?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eI would answer that question by explaining our three-pillar business strategy because it's very innovative. You know, we've been innovating in the tech, but we also try to be innovative in the business. And the three-pillar business strategy is the answer to that. So let me explain what that is. So in the first pillar, we power devices and products like cars, TVs, and IoT devices. There will be 75 billion IoT devices projected by 2025. So the order of magnitude is larger than smartphones. And most of these devices don't have either the physical room or economical room to add, like a touchscreen or keyboard, or mouse. But the microphone is small and inexpensive. And that's all it takes to add voice to these products. So 75 billion devices, from cars, TVs, IoT devices, and appliances, can be voice-enabled. That's our pillar one. And the business model before that is very proven, you know, we get a royalty. And then we have edge and cloud. In the second pillar, we power services, like food ordering for restaurants and customer service, and think of restaurants as what books spread on Amazon. So Amazon started by selling books. They only did that a lot of people knew Amazon as an online bookstore. And when they did that really well, they did more things. And now they sell everything from A to Z. So for restaurants, there's a very complex problem. We have a lot of focus on that now. And then we'll expand to other areas. So that would be pillar two. So pillar one, and pillar two, are very, very proven business models; they don't depend on each other success of one doesn't depend on the success of the other one. And the third pillar is when we bring them together. So we bring the services that the voice-enabled to the products that be voice-enabled. And that creates a commerce ecosystem. So while you're driving your car, you can talk to your car to control the air conditioning and the radio and navigation, then you can also order food, conveniently and from restaurants that we are both enabled. And this ecosystem benefits everyone. Users, who are the most important part of the equation, are delighted because of the convenience and speed of ordering. Restaurants are happy because they get new leads from the ecosystem. And there's a lead revenue that they share with us. And then, we share that revenue with the product leaders with that car maker with the TV maker. And they benefit as well because, in many cases, they are able to generate incremental recurring revenue for the first time from the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eFascinating; it's been such an interesting part of the debate around AI lately, lots of conversation, talking about how the users of these new technologies are going to have to think perhaps much differently about privacy, or bias, or other ethical topics. When it comes specifically to voice AI and everything that you've seen. What are maybe some of the challenges through that ethical or privacy-focused lens that your space faces?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, yeah, so those are big challenges. And they're distinct challenges to privacy is one and bias another one. So we've seen, you know, videos and write the news when you know AI does says the wrong thing or unacceptable things undesired outcome, those happen, and the privacy's and other things like devices are always listening. So on the privacy side, that's one of the advantages that we deliver to our customers: we let them define their privacy policy and let them be as transparent as they want. And as restrictive as they want. In the way, they integrate both AI. And that's one of the disadvantages that, for example, if they get it from the big tech, they just inherit their privacy policy; whatever it is, they can't really control it. So we give flexibility to our customers. And one of the areas that can address privacy concerns is the recognition of the edge. So there's the cloud, and there's the edge so, so you're increasingly seeing both demand from our customers and our ability to run everything on the edge. So, for example, that user's voice doesn't need to leave the device, and then you can have devices that always listen without sharing your audio with third parties. On the bias. That's another challenge. And we are committed to being a pioneer in addressing those challenges. Our approach is that we combine machine learning models and software engineering algorithms to create our solutions. And the software sets the boundaries for the machine learning models. And then machine learning models are companions that make our solutions better within those boundaries that are set by our software engineers. So most of these undesired outcomes, and these are scenarios that you see in the news and other demos, are when machine learning models don't have boundaries, and then they learn from bad data, and then they have unpredictable behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eTo wrap everything together, Keyvan, what are some of the priorities that you and your team have in 2023 and beyond were the big growth opportunities that you guys are looking to lean into?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo the world has changed. And we are adapting and transforming to the change changes. We are transforming to be a much more financially efficient organization by reducing our costs while still growing our revenue at a very healthy rate. And our goal is to become profitable and cashflow positive within this year. We announced at the end of Q3 of the year, in quiet periods after only us will be publicly disclosed last time end of Q3 we had over $300 million of booking backlog. These are from committed customers. So we have a really solid foundation for our revenue growth with our reduced costs and increased focus. We believe we will increase our revenue growth this year, and we'll achieve our goal of becoming cash flow positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThese are big goals, and wishing you all the very best of luck as you pursue those. Just thank you again, Keyvan Mohajer. For everything you shared with us, and your insights, it has been a long journey and really ahead of the explosion in interest.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eHello everybody and welcome to Public Live. I'm your host Ann Berry and looking back, it has been a bit of a bumpy and unpredictable year in the markets. But some pockets did see momentum, one of them being electric vehicles, which stand to benefit potentially from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed earlier this year. So that's what we're going to focus on today, electric vehicles or EVs, their latest developments, and what's on the horizon as we head into 2023. Here to discuss all of this is Jay Jacobs, US head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares. Jay, welcome back to Public Life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd thanks so much for having me. It is great to be back on Public Live for one more time in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eI cannot believe 2022 is nearly over. I feel like the EV sector share, when you look at their share prices, are probably pretty glad that we're going into a new year, a new chapter, and putting this one behind us definitely had a busy couple of years, we have seen looking back at this year an increased interest from consumers, two major ride-hailing companies all promising to adopt electric vehicles into their fleets and the industry has been one that just can't seem to slow down. So I'd love to kick off today's show with you by walking through some of the highlights that you've tracked from the last year in the sector.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I would say there are a few things. You know, first off, this was really kind of the year where EVs became less of a niche product and more of a mainstream product. We see that in adoption numbers. So if you look at the first half of 2022, EVS made up 26% of car sales in China, about 20% of passenger car sales in Europe, and the US actually lagging behind by only about 6%. But that is still very big numbers in a very large market around the world, showing that EVs are really coming onto the scene in a meaningful way. You add, on top of that, that we've had several car models come out this year. So basically, every major car brand has an EV now, and you see, it's not just sports cars, SUVs, it's vans, it's lower price sedans, really a model for every kind of buyer and price point out there. And then finally, yeah, we have the Inflation Reduction Act, which is one of the largest commitments ever to support the adoption of electric vehicles and clean energy, about $370 billion from the US government over the next 10 years or so, which is going to provide things like subsidies for building EV subsidies for buying EVs to really accelerate the growth of this segment. So it was, yes, 2020 was a difficult year for almost any investor in any segment of the market. EVs not being the exception. But there were a lot of things to still get excited about in the Eevee space and 2022.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eJay, let's break down a little bit more the legislation and hone in on the role of the Inflation Reduction Act. You hit the headlines for $370 billion over how long is that investment going to be made?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it's roughly over about 10 years. This doesn't all get spent at once. And that's kind of the design, right, is that what the IRA is trying to do is accelerate the adoption of a technology that otherwise is seeing good adoption, but the US government wants to do it faster. And there are really two different ways to do that. One is increased demand. And the easiest way to increase demand is to make something cheaper. So the way that they're doing that is a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, a $4,000 tax credit for used EVs, spurring demand by making them more affordable. The other way to do that is to increase supply. And that's actually incredibly important in the market that we're in today. Because there are actually not enough EVs to buy right now. If you try to buy a Ford F150 Lightning, you can't do it. If you want to buy, you know, some of the top models, you know, model three long ranges and make Mustangs, there are long waits, if you can even get on a waitlist right now. So the idea is, how do we spur more supply by using things like incentive tax credits and production tax credits to get these companies to build more manufacturing plants in the United States as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting that you break down the demand and supply aspects of it so succinctly, Jay. When you think about which of those pieces are going to have the nearest term momentum, tax credits for purchasing EVs, when are they going to kick in, and then subsidies for buying more EV plants? When are they going to start getting kicked in?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen the tax credits get hit as early as next year? The tax credits for building manufacturing plants could also start to come into play next year. But you know, we have to realize building a manufacturing plant is a two to three-year, four-year process even so we're not really going to see the commercial benefits of that for some time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's let's look a little bit more at trends for 2023, specifically Jay, which industries are looking to add EVs to their fleets? The famous one, of course, was Amazon, which had an agreement with Rivian to try and bring EVs into their delivery fleets. What are the other examples that you can walk us through of different industries moving into electric vehicle adoption?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think two are really exciting right now. So one is when we look at semi trucks, so the 18-wheelers you see on the highway, very expensive vehicles that use a lot of gas. We're starting to see progress in the electrification of that fleet. And astute listeners may have noticed the Tesla semi has been tested on the roads recently, with companies like PepsiCo putting in orders for dozens of Tesla semis going forward. So that's a really exciting development in switching the fleet from gas to electric. And then secondly, this just came out yesterday; the US Postal Service, which is the biggest operator of vehicles in the federal government in the United States, is going to put in place about 66,000 electric vehicles over the next decade or so. So this is massive, this is going from, you know, just electric vehicles being kind of a niche sports car, to really being the predominant form of passenger vehicles or light-duty vehicles or even heavy-duty vehicles and the Tesla semi example going forward. So these are exciting times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is x 1000s. Quite the number doing know, Jay, which manufacturers and which brands are going to be procured from.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, they're there from a couple of brands. One is Oshkosh, which is more of a military supply company, but builds a lot of postal service car tracks, and the others are going to come from the private sector, more from major car brands even announced which ones yet. Here's the fun fact, though, the little postal service truck that people have seen on the roads for decades only gets about eight miles per gallon. So you can see pretty quickly how switching to an electric really ramps up the efficiency of the postal service not just to reduce emissions, but to reduce operating costs; no longer paying so much for gas can actually really lower costs for shipping.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk a little bit about EV stocks, Jay, because for people interested in electric vehicles and looking to play in the market, I'm curious if you'd be able to share some of the high-level signals or metrics that you and your team look for when evaluating EV players?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. So really, the primary thing that we look at is revenue from the EV ecosystem. Now the art in that is really what is the EV ecosystem. It's very obvious to say that EV manufacturers, like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already, are very key to the electric manufacturers like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already are very key to the electric vehicle theme. But it actually goes far beyond that. And so you can think about, you know, who are the companies that actually build the batteries that go into electric vehicles, they're obviously part of the ecosystem, who's doing the lithium mining and processing that goes into those batteries, who's building the electronics and the parts that are supplied into electric vehicles. And there are really dozens of companies beyond some of the headline names that are really participating in the ecosystem. We often call this thematic beta or thematic risk, the risk here being these companies are tied to the potential adoption of electric vehicles. If the adoption for electric vehicles happens the way that we expect it to, these companies will be rewarded for that risk. If electric vehicles get supplanted by new technology, or for some reason, don't make it, they don't get escape velocity, and the internal combustion engine lives on, then companies with this thematic risk would be punished. But what we are really looking at is what are the companies that have that highest thematic risk to the electric vehicle ecosystem. And we really measure that by who gets the most revenue from electric vehicles and the entire ecosystem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd how about in the US versus internationally? I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act here in the US has caused enormous momentum domestically. Are there players you look at or parts of the supply chain that you look at internationally and that are publicly traded?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, this is a theme that is not confined to borders. Yes, we saw, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States. You know, we've seen other efforts in China and Europe to spur greater electric vehicle adoption as well. So it's really a global theme, and we see global companies participating in it. There are a lot of battery manufacturers coming from South Korea and beyond. There are a lot of lithium miners in Australia. There are parts suppliers all around the world as well. So when we think about this theme, we are absolutely looking at it through global hubs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCan we talk a little bit about how EV ETFs work Jay, as an investor, thinking about adding EV exposure to their portfolio\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. So EV ETFs are really trying to get exposure to that EV ecosystem by investing in companies around the world. So, for example, our IDRV ETF and iShares invest in lithium mining companies, refiners, battery producers, and car manufacturers in the electric vehicle space, as well as part suppliers, and really provides exposure to that entire ecosystem in one ETF. This has many benefits for investors, but one of them being it's hard to identify these companies on your own because they're not just US large-cap brand names. It can be smaller international companies. It's just hard for individual investors to access this ecosystem at the individual stock level. Secondly, there's just a lot of efficiency and doing this through an ETF rather than going out and buying 50 companies around the world on your own. You can put in an order for one ETF like IDRV and get exposure to that entire basket with one trade. So, you know, when we design an ETF like IDRV, we're really focused on capturing the pure-play companies across the entire ecosystem of a theme, in this case, electric vehicles, to get that exposure to investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd then, Jay, could you give us a little bit of color on a couple of things that help with the myth-busting? Because EVs have tended to seem like the cars of the future. They're sort of here with us now. But what are some of the assumptions that people may still have about electric vehicles that maybe just aren't true?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think one of the biggest misconceptions is that they're still expensive. Yes, there are EVs at very high price points. But there's actually several models that are coming in below the average purchase price of a new vehicle in the United States, which is about $50,000 these days. On top of that, you have tax credits, which can make them even cheaper. And then, on top of that, you have lower maintenance. So electric vehicles don't need an oil change each year. Actually, through regenerative braking, it's less frequent that you need to do brake pads and brake rotor replacement. No spark plugs to replace every 50,000 miles. So it is already cheaper in many instances to own an electric vehicle than an internal combustion engine when you look at the entire lifetime ownership. So you ought you add all that together. And the economic argument for electric vehicles is really starting to come into the forefront here, which we believe is only going to accelerate adoption. It's not just about is this a better car? Do I like the car? Do I like how it looks? If it is cheaper off the land or cheaper over the lifetime ownership experience? We think that's really going to bring the mass markets into the Evie space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat about Jay, one thing that just come up? Recently, I looked at a company that was trying to find ways to make it easier for Evie owners to be able to charge their vehicles. How about that element? Is the infrastructure going to be there to support getting more electric vehicles on the roads?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's certainly growing. And we've been talking a lot about the Inflation Reduction Act. But another piece of policy in the United States is really accelerating electric charging, which was the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act passed last November. The idea behind that act is to put about seven and a half billion dollars into building 500,000 chargers around the country. So a lot more densification of electric charging. This, in many ways, is basically a subsidy for EV buyers because if there are more chargers and there are faster chargers, in the places that you want to see them. You don't need as big of a battery. And so, if you have a smaller battery, you don't have to pay as much for an electric vehicle. So you can see how different policies from the US government are really trying to accelerate adoption, whether it's tax credits for buyers, whether it's incentives for manufacturers, or building up a charging infrastructure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWith that, I want to thank you, Jay Jacobs, Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares. And thank you to our partners at iShares for making today's show possible. We'll be back soon with even more information on all things science, healthcare, and tech, three of my favorite topics.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture and investing. I'm your host, Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Before we get into it, let's get the energy in the room up. Let's hit that like button. We've got a really exciting episode for you guys with some great guests. So let's get into that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we are joined by Dylan and Bradley from Altan insights, the leading platform for alternative asset investing, intelligence and analysis. Dylan and Bradley will be sharing some of the biggest findings from their latest research on the sports collectibles market covering both sports cards and memorabilia. Since we're going to be talking about so many current events and what's happening in these markets, at the moment through the report, and there's a lot to get through, we're going to skip the five and five and jump directly into it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo without further ado, let me hand it over to the guests. Dylan, Bradley, could you quickly reintroduce yourself to the audience? I know you've come on Public live a few times. Introduce yourself and Altan insights. Give us a bit of an overview of the new report that you've just released about sports collectibles in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. Thanks, Calum and thanks for having us back. My name is Dylan Dittrich, and I kind of lead the research effort at Altan Insights. And what Altan really focuses on is kind of empowering and arming the modern investor to explore alternative asset classes. Specifically, we look at collectible asset classes, things like fine art, wine, sports collectibles, classic cars. And so providing research analysis and data to kind of dig deeper into those asset classes, understand how they perform and understand the different kinds of forces that drive them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so as part of that effort on a quarterly basis, we put out a report on the state of the sports collectibles market, how sports cards are performing, how sports memorabilia is performing, you know, what are the different trends in different sports? How are collectors and investors approaching these categories? So I certainly would encourage everybody to visit the site and download the report if you're interested and have the time - but it was certainly an interesting second quarter to chronicle. Much like other assets that can be more speculative in nature, sports collectibles were challenged in some pockets, but had some really kind of interesting and even encouraging things happening in others. So looking forward to kind of diving into those with you guys today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd I'll just second Dylan. Thank you for having me on. I'm with Altan Insights as well. I do research alongside Dylan. I worked on the sports collectibles report that we put out recently in the first and second quarters as well as our art report and I’m also a qualified appraiser with the International Society of appraisers covering art, collectibles and memorabilia. So I've always had a big interest in the valuations of these assets, following them as actual investable vehicles and just tracking the data and the performance records everything that you can see in our reports on a quarterly basis, and you know, just putting out the research that we do looking at the sales and kind of going beyond just the numbers, so thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, great. Thank you both for the introduction. I want to get straight into the report. So like, what have we learned about the sports collectibles market in Q2? And I want to take kind of one of the big points that you made in that report, which was, are we seeing a healthy reset of the market away from speculation, or has a paradigm shift occurred that will change the way these markets perform going forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think just to zoom out a little bit, like some other categories of when, when the pandemic hit, kind of fueled by nostalgia fueled by stimulus checks, fueled by more time at home, sports collectibles really started to soar. So sports cards in particular, as people kind of, you know, revisited old treasures that might have been in the basement or the attic, and kind of revisited hobbies from their past. And it just brought a huge new audience into this space. And with that new demand came, you know, very rapid appreciation in these categories. And, as was the case, in other categories that saw similarly heightened demand over the last few years, the second quarter of 2022, was was challenging, as people became kind of skittish about the state of the economy, skittish about, you know, traditional financial markets, they were relatively eager and willing to sell these assets. And in many cases, that led to, you know, significant kind of declines in value across many different categories within the sports collectible space. And so I think a part of that is, is very likely a healthy reset of perhaps some things that had run a little bit too high, too fast.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think it's also important to add the caveat that, you know, it seems kind of indisputable that since before the last few years, the audience has definitely grown for the long term. And so, you know, we'd still expect to see there, you know, be more interested in this space than there was previously. But you know, when there's economic economic turmoil, when there's traditional financial market turmoil, it's not uncommon to see speculative assets like these sell off, even though that hasn't necessarily always been the case in sports collectibles. You know, historically, in other moments of financial crisis, economic crisis 2008, 2009, for example, you know, there are indices that suggest that sports cards didn't sell off that much. But, you know, we live in a very different kind of market today where people can basically sell cards that at a moment's notice, you know, friction is much lower than it has been in the past. And so when kind of investor and collector sentiment turns, you know, people can act on that, and so very easily nowadays and, and I think that played a role in sending some valuations lower in q2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eBradley, did you want to jump in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eI second Dylan on that. And also say that while we saw those pullbacks within the broader market, and I'm sure we'll touch on the upper end of the market, it continued to hold up well, which is something we haven't seen tested over the last few years, right. These are markets that have been tracked in some cases for decades now, and to see the broader market pull back rather significantly, and in some cases, well beyond even just a traditional stock market or other asset classes, but then to also simultaneously see the highest end of the card market your your blue chip type cards and memorabilia, seeing record prices, and in some cases, the auctions seeing heightened volume, more bidders, an increase in bids on high end cards definitely showed just a shift almost, when you look at a traditional market, that movement from maybe growth to value that you see sometimes in downturns. So it's certainly some things that we see across other markets are being replicated in sports collectibles as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. And just as a point for both of you, definitely feel free to just jump in whenever you want. We want to be as much of a conversation as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think you both made some great points. Dylan, I wanted to pick up on one thing you mentioned, which is the sports card market today, there's a lot less friction when it comes to access to liquidity. Could you go a bit deeper into that like, versus what we've seen historically, what are some of the factors that have caused there to be a lot less friction in the market, it's a lot easier for people to, like exit their position. Is that auctions? Is that the fractional markets? What are some of those factors that have caused that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think when you think about all of this new demand that's come into the space, you know, with that comes investment dollars and the pursuit of innovation, to make things, you know, easier on that new demand to make it easier for them to transact. And so I think a lot of the leading platforms in the space, whether you're talking about auction houses, whether you're talking about marketplaces, the technology that they're using has advanced considerably. The marketing around auctions has increased considerably, the frequency of auctions has increased considerably. And there's also a lot of, you know, competition to be the venue where people are buying and selling sports collectibles, and so that has the power to lower costs as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so, whereas, you know, in decades prior, somebody might move to sell a card, and they might have to wait, you know, a month or two for the next auction, or they had to, you know, create their own eBay listing and kind of wait for that to be completed, it's really a lot easier today and it takes a lot less kind of manual legwork. And there are many platforms, you know, kind of designed to make buying and selling these things akin to buying and selling stocks. And we see that with fractional platforms as well. And so there's definitely an increased focus on liquidity, which is great, that means you can convert your asset to cash in a shorter amount of time and with greater ease. But on the flip side of that, that means that, you know, a market and valuations and price levels can react a whole lot faster when people start getting a bit nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think it's such an interesting point that like the reduction in friction, means that from a psychological point of view, investors in sports cards can now act a lot more similar to how, you know, investors in more traditional assets, like stocks can behave.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I think, you know, to use an example from a more traditional asset class, you know, you know, the performance of asset classes, like private equity and private real estate, are always touted as being quite strong on a risk adjusted basis. But part of that is because the, you know, the valuations are kind of marked to market, aren’t updated with as greater frequency as public markets. And these, you know, private investment firms aren't buying and selling with as much frequency as actors and traditional public markets. So in a way that kind of smooths over those, those rough economic and financial patches, it's not to say that their performance isn't strong, but there's there is kind of an element of the way that it's measured, you know, kind of making things look a little bit stronger on paper sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, that's a really interesting point. I want to get a bit deeper into the data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Bradley, maybe we can check to you for this one. I know one of the things that you mentioned in the report, was that you use the PWCC indices to kind of understand the market and what's happening. Can you quickly just explain to our audience, first of all, why is the PWCC indices so important for that? And then also, what are some of the limitations of using those indexes to look at the market today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. So PWCC they’re a marketplace and auction house and they have multiple indices, they have five ranging from the PWCC, 100 500, and then 2500. And their indices track a range of cards, but they are primarily vintage based. So you mentioned, like some of the shortfalls of those indices, one of them is that they do primarily track vintage cards, so cards dating really pre 1980s. And so PWCC, they really have the longest tenure as a performance tracking metric, they date back to the early…actually to 2008 is when the PWCC indices start. So you kind of get that tail and in the 2009 timeframe of the financial crisis. So you have one of the reasons why I believe that they're used so frequently is not only because they date back, but more importantly, because they date back to a very specific moment in financial markets history. And they, if you look at the indices, they do change in terms of their composition, but they primarily revolve around your blue chip Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth cards, whether they're rookies or just pre-war, or close to post-war cards, and those cards while they've performed very well, it's not always the greatest representation of the overall market. As I had discussed previously about how the broader market struggled but the blue chip higher end market performed very well, we just saw that happen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if you're looking at, you know, the last six to nine months, you might see a lot of cards across the board. And a lot of cars, maybe people on here owned, have maybe dropped in value. But meanwhile, we're seeing some record sales for Honus Wagner or Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth, or whoever that player might be in their rookie cards or in some of their early cards, that maybe is not the greatest representation of the overall market. So that's the one challenge, it is used just because we need some way of tracking an industry that has a composition of multiple cards across a span of time. But as with any industry, it might not be the best representation of the overall market and also of the sale frequency. So it's not necessarily looking at in a downturn market, is the volume still the same? Are people still selling their cards in that period of time? Are people still buying those cards in that period of time? Is the market still as active? There's a lot of metrics that maybe aren't incorporated in some of those indices, which do create the shortfalls, but are still important to include in any research and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eI think it's such an interesting distinction, definitely when I started to learn more about sports cards, the distinction between like the vintage older cards, and then the more modern sports card, and perhaps you can both touch on this. Why do vintage markets perform so differently than like, more modern sports cards? Is it purely just about scarcity and supply? Or are there other factors that we can look at?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so this is, this was definitely one of the more interesting kind of tidbits to come out of our Q2 analysis. If you looked at second quarter performance of vintage and prewar cards, they were effectively flat down very, very slightly 1 to 2% versus modern and ultra modern cards, which were down in the neighborhood of 15 to 20%. And I think part of that is, you know, modern and ultra modern tend to be a bit more speculative in nature, you have speculation on players that are currently active younger players, people who have more of their career left in some areas, particularly in the ultra modern space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd when you look at vintage, there's a very long tenured collector base, the scarcity is naturally very low, just just by nature of the fact that these cards have been around for decades and decades. You know, over time, some have been lost, they've been damaged, so supply is very low. And I think, you know, many collectors aren't turning these cards over with as great a frequency - they're holding on to them. And that means less supplies available to the market, which of course can help keep, you know, prices kind of higher as demand grows, or even stays the same. And that's where you find a lot of quote unquote, blue chip cards that are very, very popular historically that are very well known, that are kind of like the top pieces of almost akin to fine art in this category. So a bit less speculation, less supply, and more longer tenured collectors and holders of these assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and then just to add, there's also been so many market shifts across you know, when these cards were initially coming out, think about some of the cards maybe you've seen breaking records like a T 206 Honus Wagner like these were really advertisements. They weren't built for card collectors. They weren't being produced in mass for you know..they were being produced and then slid into a pack of gum or candy or cigarettes, or they were being stuck at tables at diners. They weren't being produced where then we saw that shift in the 70s, 80s, 90s, where then it rotated into what is known as the junk wax era where you had producers of cards, pumping out incredibly high quantities of cards. There's a ton out on the market, you don't really see a whole lot of 1990s players with high, high sales in their cards and today, the shift has really turned to grading where we’re seeing such an increase in cards being graded. People are sending them off to places like Beckett, PSA, SGC to be graded and a very high percentage of cards within populations are being graded. So it's just been a real overall shift in the market that has definitely aided I think vintage as standing out and standing alone from a period of time where people weren't collecting cards maybe for investment pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e Bradley can you kind of go –I think that's a really interesting point you brought up on the grading, right? Can you kind of go a bit deeper? What is the impact on the market overall of you know, you're getting more PSA 10s You're getting more BGS 9.5 or whatever, like, what is the impact on vintage versus modern?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. It’s an impact that I don't think is probably being discussed enough. We do cover it quite a bit. We have a partnership with a company called Gem Rate, who tracks the percentage and the number of cards graded by companies like I mentioned previously, PSA, Beckett,STC. And for example, just PSA alone, they're seeing record cards coming through and being graded in items altogether. You know, their Q2 numbers, and this past quarter were the highest they've ever had graded. I believe the past month was their highest month on record. So at this point, you know, they've had two months this year, believe it was March, and then now July that have been their two highest grading totals in company history, in terms of just number of items.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that impacts everything because a lot of these prices, especially in modern cards are dictated by the grade. So for example, PSA grades on a numeric scale one to 10. With as well as an authentic grade if the card is maybe in too poor of quality, to receive a number. But a PSA 10, which would be like a gem mint card, the highest tier, will historically sell for higher than a PSA nine of that same card, right? There may be a flaw in the nine that deducts that one point. The problem is that people today are pulling cards out of packs and sending them immediately to PSA, the card has a higher chance than receiving a 10. And in turn, that overall population is skyrocketing, right? We're seeing some players like in the NBA, Zion Williamson, John Moran, where they have super high numbers of - I mean talking 10s of 1000s of PSA 10 graded cards for some of their base cards right now. Where for example, with the vintage, you have to almost get to the 60s before you start seeing a lot of these cards, receiving tents and that just comes down to people weren't pulling them and sending them out\u0026nbsp;immediately from packs. So it definitely is having an impact. And I think long term, we're going to see a swell of cards that were graded, that received 10s. It's going to be very difficult to really ever find appreciation and an increase in value when you have a card that has 20,000+ grades, and then maybe 10 to 15% of that population is a PSA 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd if you think about it, Calum, if you're an owner of a great advantage card, the threat of the population have that card growing now and really making your card a lot less valuable just by nature of the supply growing is a lot lower relative to modern because you know these cards have been in circulation they've been unwrapped from packs decades ago, you know, every now and then yes, some some new population will find its way to the to the grading companies. But you know, the likelihood of that happening at scale is much lower than it is for modern and ultra modern cars, and that's why the kind of the risk return formula, so to speak, for vintage is a lot different than it is for modern and ultra modern cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think that's super interesting. I'm going to ask one more question on the card point before we shift over to game one memorabilia and memorabilia overall, which I know is a very different picture than the card market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think one thing that was interesting as I was going through the report is amongst all kind of the doom and gloom in the sports card market, there were some promising signs. The economist David RPA, modern hockey card record sale at Heritage last month, the upcoming heritage auction for the Mantle. Can you both just kind of comment on those two sales and what you think they might indicate about the market overall as we look forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean the Mantle sale - so for context, one of the very highest graded 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle cards is up for auction at Heritage auction later this month, the special card because basically what happened was, these cards weren't wildly popular. When they were released back in 1952. They sat on shelves, and it was time for basically the 1953 print run to start being sold and tops needed the warehouse space. So they basically dumped boxes, and boxes and boxes of these cards into the ocean. And Mickey Mantle is kind of one of the preeminent, you know, baseball, cultural icons, certainly baseball card icons. And so probably one of the four very best examples of this card is being auctioned later this month. It's already over $7 million at auction, there's, I think, a pretty strong expectation that it's going to end up at $10 million plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time there was a sale of..so that's an SGC 9.5 Mickey Mantle. Back in early 2021, there was a sale of a PSA nine mantle for $5.2 million. And, you know, the stats are pretty clear that afterwards, not only did the broader and kind of lower quality Mantle market absolutely soar higher, but you could make the argument that, you know, it led to, you know, significant appreciation in the broader card market as well. It's a really big deal when a sale that big makes a very wide range of mainstream news headlines, because that creates new demand. It gets people excited about the space again, and it tends to have pretty wide ranging impacts. Now granted, it does take a sale of $5 million or $10 million to generate that excitement, which is exceedingly rare, but it does happen and it'll be really interesting to see, you know, what happens in the wake of that sale next month, or later this month rather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd all along the Mantle card has always stood out from a baseball standpoint, similar to in hockey. We've had a seven figure sale of Wayne Gretzky, but we have also been tracking as you mentioned, the McDavid card. So modern hockey has similar to some of the other modern sports has lagged pretty significantly in terms of the overall market. So in the first quarter, golden oxygens sold a Sidney Crosby card. It was a gold precious metal gems and went for 100 in just under $165,000, which set a record for any modern hockey card. And then in this past quarter or the past quarter we've just had or past month, there was a 2015 Connor McDavid card, which is an autographed patch card. So it has a patch from a game worn jersey within it, and it's sold for $228,000. So that established a new modern hockey card price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd actually, this is very timely, because just this week, there was one of the other so there are three cards in the population for the Connor McDavid that are graded PSA 10, and another one just sold this week for just over $200,000. So heading into the second quarter, we had never had a sale for a modern hockey card go for more than $200,000 and now we've had one, you know, essentially in the past 30 days now we've had two cards, same card, same grade, but it was definitely a validating sale to see one sell via eBay for over $200,000. So definitely some momentum within that market. But again, it's really a couple names: Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby, Alexander Ovechkin. But beyond those three, hockey though, just continues to trail the field overall for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, very interesting. I'm conscious that we're nearly at time. Everyone can stay on if they're interested to hear more, because we're gonna go into the sports memorabilia market. And I think if Q1 was kind of, you know, there was a plunging in the sports card market. I think it was the exact reverse on the sports memorabilia side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould you, and I'll put this to both of you. Can you kind of just give us some context, data wise what we saw with sports memorabilia, and then also like, what is the significance like why did this happen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so on kind of the second part of that question first. So when the sports card market was was booming, you'd see, and Bradley just alluded to one of them, you would see these cards that have little patches from either a game worn or player player worn jersey, selling for, you know, hundreds of 1000s of dollars, which in many cases is more than a full game used jersey would actually sell for. And so I think for the last few years, people both outside of the space, especially but also inside the space, have kind of taken a step back and said like, that doesn't make any sense. Like why is this little patch that's, you know, encased in cardboard selling for more than an entire game use jersey. And I think, you know, the idea that that shouldn't necessarily be the case has started to take hold, and the second quarter we saw, really for the entirety of 2022, but really in the second quarter we saw game worn jersey sales make headlines, there was a Diego Maradona, game worn jersey from the famous Hand of God World Cup match sold for over $9 million. Sotheby’s Golden Age auctions sold a set of Tiger Woods clubs from when he won the tiger slam for over $5 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so we just saw a huge volume of sales that were kind of headline sales that were over six figures. So to put it in context, in the second quarter of 2022. There were 42 sales at auctions of game used memorabilia that crossed $100,000. A year ago in the second quarter, there were just 13. So you're talking about more than triple, you know, increase. And I think a lot of that is, you know, card collectors coming into this space and realizing that there's, you know, an opportunity to own some incredible artifacts that, you know, maybe stand out from kind of the traditional to their traditional kind of cardboard pursuits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we put out actually a thread today on Twitter, Altan Insights, where we covered some of these record breaking sales and sports memorabilia. And one of the big highlights is, you know, the record books have really been reconstructed this year. There's three of the five largest public sales ever that have occurred. In terms of sports memorabilia, just this year alone. Dylan mentioned the Maradonna and then also the Tiger Woods. Also the Muhammad Ali championship belt that's sold. So we're just seeing the shift of people going after these really high end really impressive items that have historic context around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it's really exciting to see this shift in this movement of money that's going after you look at even at the Heritage auction coming up that we mentioned, there's the Mickey Mantle card, and that's going to be the big headline grabber. But very likely we'll see a new record set for a baseball bat. There's a 1918,1920 circa Babe Ruth game used in sign that that right now is priced just under a million dollars. I wouldn't be surprised if it by the end of the auction is a multi million dollar bat. It's a really impressive piece that is one of the earliest bats on the market that we've ever seen. I know there's been a lot of collectors out there looking for Babe Ruth's first bat that he used. So that had hit the market back in the early 2000s and went for over a million dollars. It hasn't came back yet. But this bat is probably about the second best thing that we've ever seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the momentum is just continuing within the space. And also just announced yesterday, I believe Sotheby's is going to be selling a Michael Jordan jersey from the 1998 NBA Finals. And that jersey will likely establish not only a new record for any Michael Jordan, game use jersey, but actually any basketball jerseys. We would need to get up to about 4 million to do that. It has an estimate between 3 to 5 million, but with the momentum we're seeing in the prices for other athletes like Ali marathon Tiger Woods, probably seems fitting that Michael Jordan would fit in somewhere in that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNow that's pretty iconic. You know, one thing I wanted to follow up on when we talk about these really high sale prices, especially with sports memorabilia. I know one thing that comes into it is the photo matching element. Could you guys just speak briefly about - refresh the audience on what is photo matching, first of all? And then why has it become so important in the valuation of these assets?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, photo matching has become a critically important topic. I think it always, not always, but it has been important over the last few years, but its importance has only increased as you see these very high value auction items being sold, and therefore the stakes being raised. And essentially, for those that don't know, you know, if you talk about something like a Michael Jordan worn jersey, or you know, a Wayne Gretzky worn jersey from the Stanley Cup, you want to know, if you're paying millions of dollars for this item? How do I know that he wore it in this game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so what photo matching is to kind of simplify it is basically comparing the game worn Jersey in question to very high resolution photos taken during the game in question, to match up very kind of, in most cases, minute details to confirm that this is indeed the jersey that was worn by that player in that game. And it can be things as small as you know, different holes in the mesh different, you know, little pieces of stitching, and how they appear on the jersey and, and matching those elements to the Jersey that's being sold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, I think when these very large prices are being paid, authentication is so very critical for the credibility of the market, for the credibility of those selling the item. And then for the buying collector to you know, be reassured that the item they've spent money on was who was really as built. And so photo matching is one way that that's accomplished. And you're kind of hard pressed to see nowadays, items sell for very high values without being photo matched to, you know, a certain moment. Generally not the case for more vintage items, for obvious reasons that the high resolution photography that you need to really make a conclusive photo match wasn't available until really, really more recently, but definitely important for any kind of more modern piece of game worn material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd to follow up, we dove into some of the data behind that photo matching and just looking at so in Q2, out of the top 10 sales, eight of them were marketed as being photo matched. And so there's a few companies out there Resolution, My Gray, who photo match these items, and 18 of the top point five items sold memorabilia wise at auction in the second quarter, add some label or some nod to photo matching, and that compares to 60% of the top 10, the previous year, 12 out of the top 25. So a pretty big difference. It's been around as Dylan had mentioned, but at this point, especially as we start to see these modern assets and the memorabilia side, continue to develop in price, it's pretty much necessary outside of a certificate or a letter of authenticity from the league, or the player itself. You know, memorabilia has always been a little bit of a money market because a lot of these assets weren't supposed to ever make it to an auction house, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Tiger Woods clubs that Golden Age sold, there was a little dispute because Tiger Woods and his agent claimed to still have the clubs, because there's almost this idea that they're not supposed to ever leave the player and it's somebody's responsibility to grab that jersey after the game and keep it, or to secure the club so they never see an auction house. But it was the work of some experts in the space that looked at a bunch of attributes around the clubs between the grip to ball marks to photos, and then were able to provide an opinion a photo match that pretty clearly had an impact considering they sold for over $5 million and easily exceeded any previous golf clubs sold by about $5 million. So it's having an impact on these markets, no question about it. And I really think in the next few years, it's going to become...if it's anything that is photo-matchable so it's not vintage, but it's anything really 1970 on it's going to require some sort of photo matching being a given for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's really interesting, and to be honest, it's pretty incredible that some of these assets they can even match it using photographs and all these things. Before we close out, I wanted to talk about the Muhammad Ali belt. Huge sale, there $6.18 million. I think the initial estimate was to be around like a million dollars.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you talk about what was the level of photo matching that we saw there? What was some of the story behind that? Like, why did it exceed the estimate by such a large degree?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is actually one of those interesting and rare cases where there actually wasn't a photo match at hand. And really, what the kind of source of you know, credibility and authenticity here was the provenance so meaning what was kind of the line of ownership from, you know, when the belt was on Muhammad Ali to when it came to auction. So a little bit of background, I think it was last month, heritage sold the WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that Muhammad Ali earned for his win in the Rumble in the Jungle, and they sold it for just under $6.2 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis one came from the collection of Drew Bandini Brown, who was Ali's corner man. He kept a lot of artifacts, memorabilia from all of his career in a storage unit. Eventually, the contents of that storage unit were sold. But it's a case where you know you have pretty strong provenance. You know where that belt’s been, you feel fairly confident that this is a belt that was earned by Ali - it was worn by Ali.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it really led to a bidding war between two bidders who were seemingly unwilling to lose. Turns out the winner was Colts owner Jim Irsay, who has basically been building a museum quality collection of kind of American cultural artifacts that he's actually taken on tour. So it's like, it's one of my favorite kind of investing rules for you know, really blue chip alternative collectibles is like, would Jim Irsay buy this because time and time again, he invariably shows up as a winner of a lot of these auctions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, one of those rare cases where, you know, photo matching wasn't playing a significant role in the authenticity here. But sometimes at an auction, all it takes is two highly motivated bidders to drive a value to, you know, levels that people previously thought were unheard of. Especially interesting in this case, because there is another WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that actually trades fractionally. And, you know, now that the question becomes, you know, what's that one worth? So definitely an interesting, very interesting piece of memorabilia. Very interesting story, and, you know, another just massive result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eJust as a follow up, I actually spoke this week with a representative from Heritage who runs some of their consignment, and was talking to him at one point about that night when it's sold, and it was out of the blue for them. So we talked about where something like that comes from, he had actually gone to sleep, said he woke up at like 3am and stuff was like still going. And to see, you know, they, you know, some people that are going to be involved in the auction, for example, they set a million dollar estimate, they had word of mouth from some potential betters that those bidders weren't going to let it go for under a million. But that's all it takes is two bidders on some of these items.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the same could go for this Mantle card coming up at the end of the month, or the Jordan jersey in September that I mentioned previously, like, it just comes down to if you have some people who are willing to put out that kind of money. And now we're at a point where that table and that tier has been set, where now it used to be a million dollars was a big hurdle for an auction house to clear. If they could clear that million dollar, you know, everyone was clapping and it was a really respectable auction. And that meant that they had a really strong line of bidders where it's almost 5 million at this point where, you know, it's like you're expected to have bidders lined up that are willing to push these items higher and higher the levels that we just haven't seen up until this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, it's pretty incredible to be honest, when you look at some of the other asset markets for crypto, for stocks, and you see how bearish people are and kind of the the sentiment there that we still have some of these really high ticket sales and records being broken in some of the alternative asset markets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDylan and Bradley, It's been a pleasure to have you guys on the show again, you're always welcome.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture trend investing. I'm your host Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Today, we are joined by Gerard Starkey, sports memorabilia expert, and co-founder of SAAS. Over the last 20 years, Gerard has built one of the most valuable and complete Michael Jordan player exclusive game worn collections in the world, and has been featured in Highsnobiety and elsewhere, as one of the preeminent MJ collectors. Sports memorabilia is a really exciting alts category, and he'll be demystifying it for us today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we get to that, though, we're going to cover some of the biggest headlines happening in the world of alts in a section I like to call five and five, five headlines in five minutes. Let's get started. So first of all, Nike sold a virtual NFT sneaker designed by artists to Kashi American army for $134,000. The sneaker was one of 20,000 in Nike;s first release with artifact in April. Collectors are hoping the shoes will become part of games like fortnight and Grand Theft Auto Six, while others are interested in physical versions of the shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eeBay is launching its first ever NFT collection. Thirteen limited edition NFTs that feature 3D animations of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky making one of his signature moves. They plan to drop additional NFT collections throughout the year in partnership with web3 platform OneOf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world's largest bottle of whiskey was sold for $1.4 million by auction house, Lyon and Turnbull on May 25. The bottle stands at an incredible 5’11 and was given a Guinness world record for being the world's largest bottle of whiskey in September 2021. It contains enough to fill about 444 standard bottles, or enough to make 5,287 whiskey sours, which is pretty crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew York based real estate, investment and brokerage firm Acada listed a New York building as an NFT on OpenSea for 15,000 ETH, approximately $27 million. The NFT represents ownership of the building. However, the buyer still has to follow standard real estate procedure offline for the transaction to go through.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, a former OpenSea employee has been indicted in the first ever case of NFT insider trading. Thirty-one year old former Product Manager Nathaniel Chastain was responsible for selecting which NFTS would be displayed on OpenSea’s homepage. He would then use that information to buy those NFTs before they were featured, and then flip them for 2-5x profits after that. So that's our five and five for today. We're now going to switch over to speaking with our guest Gerard Starkey. Gerard, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to have you on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks for having me on. It's a pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I'm super excited for this one. So just to begin, can you give us a backstory? I think you have like the most valuable MJ game on collection out there. Can you kind of just give us an intro into how you got into collecting these items?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI think first just to correct slightly, at one point in time, I was definitely the most valuable Michael Jordan collector, but in the recent in recent years, some very, very large investors have come in and bought up, you know, millions of millions of dollars of items in a very short span of time. So I'm definitely up there in the top two or three guys, but I'm possibly not the most valuable at this stage. But I was at one point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, you're in the conversation for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm definitely up there. But I don't want to claim the crown without giving my peers and fellow collectors, you know, the same type of esteem all the way up at the top there. For me it started before value was even a concern because for me it started out of pure passion as a teenager. And as you said earlier on, I've been collecting for about 25+ years. And I didn't necessarily start in Michael Jordan stuff. Specifically like stuff he'd actually used. It actually started just in the kind of the regular kind of original Jordans that were available at the time and and gradually progressed through the various kind of categories of collecting whether it was like originals, hard to get rare samples, back to originals again, and then the original market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginal releases of the Jordan shoes where it was very hot in late 90s, early 2000s, like it was, it just increased massively. And I actually was given a pair of game-worn Jordans from an ESPN athlete, I can go into that story at some point, but I was given them by an ESPN, so a cameraman, who was French. And when, as soon as I held that asset, the asset that I previously owned at the time, but that I previously collected didn't mean as much to me, because I had this asset that, you know, represented this athlete. And at that point, I took the opportunity to sell all my originals, which I sold very quickly. And I basically plugged it all into actual game news items. And now that was not as easy to find, but I'm quite resourceful. I speak seven or eight languages.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I basically went into the market on a global scale and just bought everything I could. And this went on for about 1015 years before the real boom happened, and I did it quite silently, because that was just my strategy, not quite being quite a competitive person. And being well, I was based in London, most of that time. So all of my peers were in Asia and the States. So for me to get stuff, I have to really hustle and bustle and just just grab as much as I could. And yeah, to this day, I don't sell my own collection, I just vault stuff and enjoy it and have it on display at my home and rotate it and collect things. I still obviously enjoy collecting. But you know, it's much harder now because the caliber of items I want to collect it's large sums of money. And I have to be quite selective, to be honest. Because I can't compete with all the bigger players in the current market. However, I obviously have a number of assets that these guys want. So the only way for me to really get into some of the really big, multimillion dollar items is to trade out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat's my collecting career in a nutshell and now I've built up so much expertise in the space that you know, I dibble and dabble in helping the Jordan Brand, do marketing campaigns. I am an adviser to big collectors around the world, helping them build up their collections. I do storytelling in displays around the world with various clients and partners. And I've got my own authentication company SAAS where, just like Public's doing, my main goal is to educate so that people can understand the assets, appreciate the assets, and get a really good sense of the value of the assets, because I think that's quite important. I think that is going to be the key element of this particular space, and actually any collecting space is going to focus on in the next sort of three to five years. It's all going to be about really getting specific, really getting clear valuations of stocks. At the moment, I think things are still bouncing around. But we'll get into that as we go through the question. So that's me and my collection, career from start to end and looking forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, sweet as you were saying that I was like, Gerard is living the dream, like the dream of any NBA fan, Michael Jordan fan. He is living it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask you because I think this is really interesting, and also just to give people in the audience a bit more context. Can you talk us through some of like those highlight pieces, those assets that are currently in your collection? Maybe like two or three of your favorite ones? And then also take us through like, how did you even get it? Maybe you can give us like a quick story of an interesting acquisition story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, I think probably the asset that I own, the pair of shoes I own that people will most likely recognize, is that I own The Shot. So I own the Black Cement Jordan 4s that Michael Jordan wore when he hit the shot over Craig Ehlo of the Cavs. And that for me is definitely in terms of emotional value an asset that captures a really big turning point not just in Michael Jordan's career but in the whole basketball, NBA kind of history. It's, in my opinion, its top three, possibly top one or two moments ever. So that's definitely, in my opinion, the biggest asset that people will really appreciate, I think on a global scale without question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI own obscure pieces like the Nike Alpha Force that Michael Jordan wore in the same kind of period, as he was wearing Jordan, threes and fours and he was trying to, you know, get comfortable in the shoes. There's some talk about him, it being a transition point, as am I going to stick with Jordan, they're trying different midsole shoes models, and he actually started wearing Nike Alpha force, which isn't the Jordan shoe. But he wore them two or three times, and I have the pair that he played in against the Milwaukee Bucks. So that's a cool, very unique piece, not as big a celebrity as The Shot. But definitely for me, it's a piece that I appreciate a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then you're seeing other other shoes that I would love to have in my collection that have eluded me. I mean, the obvious one, for me is the last shot, which is Michael Jordan's final pair of shoes, which, I mean, I've literally searched for, I mean, I'm a resourceful man. And I've searched for it far and wide. And I mean, there's two pairs out there. And one of them potentially, is that model. But there's also a possibility that Michael Jordan has kept that one himself, which would make sense to me. But it's just not a pair that I've ever been able to acquire. But that would be monumental. And I mean, the closest pair I've seen to that very last pair is actually up at Christie's actually, it's an auction I've held here, the shameless plug, but there is an amazing, low 13 game-worn Michael Jordan sample that's actually on the market as we speak. And that's pretty much as close as I think any of us will get to that last shot ever. And that's, that's an amazing piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you even think to yourself,\u0026nbsp;“I would love to own the last shot piece” or “ the last shot sneaker,” how does that process of even trying to track it down start? Is it all just personal connections? What's that research process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, I mean, my process is I mean, everybody knows I'm an actuary by profession. So my mind is quite analytical, I love a good spreadsheet. I love a good list. So over the years, I've basically built databases of you know, where these assets are, whether it's jerseys, shoes, bats, helmets, you know, not necessarily specific to Michael Jordan, but where big assets are, who owns them, you know, their numbers, their emails, some photos of those assets, the tagging just so I can keep myself fully educated as to you know, the authenticity and what I should be looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do actually have big personal databases that you know, are super valuable to me and help me try to track these things down. And once you get into the circle you know, you do meet insiders, insiders to these athletes, these these these gods so to say, of the world and you can navigate through, there is a there's a way to navigate through that community and figure out how to get out get out assets once you do a deal. Whenever I do deals in the past, it was never you were never buying one item. It wasn't efficient, you were potentially having to get on a plane and travel to Hong Kong or New York and as I said I was based in London in Europe most of the time. So if I was going in, I was going for the kill and I was going to buy as much as I could, you know? And when you get known to be a reliable person who does deals who buys stuff off the medics, the teammates, the ball boys, you know, use that they pass your lap around respectfully and they and you can you know pay the right money for the assets. And at the time it was much simpler like I said they were trying to get rid of assets anonymously without you going to the market. You know, there wasn't really a deep liquid market for them at that point. They also didn't want to be known to be selling the asset that Michael Jordan gave them, so it was much easier. But that's how I go about it and I apply the same technique. Circle still exists, you know, there are other layers, there are more auction houses, there are more dealers, there are more middlemen, but it's just navigating the space. Like any space just like buying a house or a property, it's very similar actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I want to zoom out a little bit. I know, there's probably a lot of people in the audience who are interested in potentially investing in sports memorabilia, and just learning more about the market in general, could you kind of just quickly define for us, what exactly is the sports memorabilia market, and then what makes this category special?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, sports memorabilia market as an asset, if I was thinking about in a real simple kind of definition, any asset that captures an athlete, either his image or a moment, or an event in sports history. And this can be purely a photo on a card, or an actual item used at that point in time or something with a signature from that era. It's a very broad category, so it captures the essence of an athlete.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an interesting category because, I mean, for me, first, take one quick step back to make it clear what the following statement means, to me, it's like an art. These are moments that people have created at the very peak of their career. And if anybody on the call has ever, you know, going down that route of being an athlete or doing a sport, you know, it is extremely difficult to work your way up that ladder to become the top person, just like any artists would have had to work, you know, hundreds of 1000s of hours, you know, to be known as the, you know, the Michelangelo or the Picassos of the world, you know, these athletes have created these moments by being that great. So for me, they aren't just rubber and canvas and suede and leather, and you know, and wood and whatever, whatever materials they use in the equipment. They're actual moments in time that represent something very deep, very hard to achieve, and hence, they are pieces of art, which you which become talking points become storytelling points. And that's how I treat it. So to me, it's art. It's the emotional value. It's the moment, it's a historical moment in time that they capture that they represent, that gives them value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think to your point, the emotional value is so strong, so strong, right? Like we remember those moments that MJ last game shot and different moments. One thing I'm interested in from the investor perspective, is what are some of the factors, the value drivers, of a certain piece of sports memorabilia? I know you mentioned obviously, the moment, like what it's associated with, the athlete. Is there anything else? Can you kind of just elaborate on what some of those important factors are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, those are extremely important facts that you raised. But I think rarity is key, like with any asset. And now the space is becoming much more liquid, and much more, much more educated, people really understand what rarity actually actually means. Now, for me, rarity is literally a handful, you know, and I know there are assets out there. I mean, there is an intersection between demand, and, and supply. And, you know, the perfect example for me is like the card market, the sports card market, there could be 200,000 people who want this one card, and there's only 700 of them, and that seems like a very high demand ratio. And I agree, but actually, ultimate or absolute rarity, where you can have something that like two or three or no other person has, that for me is the ultimate factor. And as we get more educated, we need to know how to filter down to what that rarity actually means. So, in cards, there's, you know, there are populations, there are I mean, you have to think of what is important in the card, what is the emotional value in a card in the card mark is my interpretation. So all the basic stuff about the quality of the card, the centering of the card, you know, the edges of the card, how perfect that card is preserved, those are all very easy parameters to understand. The hard bit is actually delving down to actual rarity and the authenticity and the you know, and the meaning meaningfulness of that card.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think with cards, the excitement usually comes from, say, pulling a card. So being able to calculate and understand the probability of you actually pulling that card that is going to be a big factor in rarity. Which athlete it was related to, that's going to have a big big driver of value and rarity, you know, within each of those athletes, each of those athletes have one or two cards that are the cards to have actually, they probably will have one card is the card. And if it is\u0026nbsp;the card that is in your basic kind of starting point, this is the card I want for Gretzky or for Mantle or for MJ. And then you have to take that particular card and then filter that particular example down into the best version of that example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith game used stuff, it's slightly more complex because once it's far more complex, because it's there's you know, authenticating a card is quite simple, because they are just pieces of paper that capture that nostalgia, authenticating and valuing game used jerseys and shoes is there a lot more intricate details to look at tags and where and you go down this angle of the photo matching, and we'll talk about a bit more about photo matching later on. But after photo matching and understanding signatures, it then gets into this kind of moment, space. And up to that photo matching kind of factor that you're considering, the prices on these things will be kept because it's you know, it's just photo matched. And it could be, you know, just a regular season game, but it's photo match, you know, he wore it. So it's great, it's a great asset, but the price will be capped. The moment it's photo matched, but also the moment that it's photo matched to a huge or significant or turning point, then the price will just shoot up. And that's because it's rarity, meaningfulness, emotional value, and, and that's what these assets, you know, that's why those assets then sort of transition from a sports card or sports item into a piece of art and a piece of history. And I think people are getting far more educated. I mean, there are a lot of sports thinkers, kind of like myself and there's lots of people in the market who\u0026nbsp;try to go out there and kind of give these parameters to people and give that kind of food for thought. So they can think about the value themselves. And it is complicated, but I do really feel that the market is getting very sophisticated. And buyers we're getting very sophisticated and very demanding. And that's right, I think, and I actually support that a lot because it gives us base credibility and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, one thing I think that's so interesting, as I was listening to you speak is that, and I think this is a great point also for our audience. As you know, they continue to learn more about alts. And I'm even on my own journey of learning more about alts. And I think every kind of alts category has its own nuances, you know, when it comes to evaluating an asset. So for instance, you gave the example of sports cards where like the grading and the condition of the card is like a huge determinant. There's different determinants when you look at things like the art market or comic book market. And then obviously, sports memorabilia. Could you just elaborate a bit more? You spoke about photo matching, can we start at the beginning? Like what is even photo matching? Can you kind of just explain that whole process, like what does it even mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eSo photo matching - this will apply to game used stuff firstly, so you photo match game used items. And what that effectively means is that using images and video for when the asset was actually used. You're effectively able to superimpose the asset you have in your hand on top of the image, and every single crease, loose thread game used blemish, production blemish lines up so that it is absolutely conclusive that the asset you have in your head is the exact asset used by Maradonna or by you know, MJ or by David Beckham. And there is zero doubt there. I mean, it's just conclusively matched and attributed to that particular moment. And then if that moment is a big moment, then that's the next stage of kind of research and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Actually, to be honest, and in my opinion, once you've got the photo matched assets, you get so far up the chain. It's the moment that really adds value. You know, and I think, and the uniqueness of that moment moment and, you know, factors that you that the asset has that relate to that moment, you know, for example, I mean, a perfect example of a photo matched asset is something that Public actually have within their portfolio is the Shattered Backboard, Air Jordan 1, which is I mean, I'm obviously biased, because, you know, I was I was involved in that particular transaction some years ago. But that asset has photos of Michael Jordan, taking off his shoes, and giving them to the other athlete. Now, that's just unheard of. And that particular nuance parameter is super important because it not only photo matches the asset to something that MJ would have worn in a big moment, but it also photo matches the backstory and the provenance. So there's, you've conclusively photo matched but also conclusively fact checked, and you have photographic evidence of the backstory and how it actually got from Michael Jordan's feet, to the open market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the fact that Michael Jordan was the person handing the asset over is so significant, because usually, it would go into the admin team or his charity team, or, you know, his, you know, there would be a process because he was such a huge, huge, huge athlete, and he was huge from from day one. I mean, people knew he was a big deal from day one. So to have an asset that comes direct from him, insane. And for me, personally, I mean, if I would have value, it's way up there. It's way up there. I mean, Maradonna’s hand of God, and you know, Kobe's rookie jerseys have absolutely nothing on that particular shoe. But it requires a level of understanding and appreciation of what it actually is, you know?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's so interesting. I'm kind of interested to talk and like, get your opinion on what's happening in the market currently. I know, if we look at the top of the market, we saw in 2021, there was the sale of the 1984, Michael Jordan Airships, which kind of set a record at Sotheby's for over $1.4 million. What have we seen happen from that point? I know you alluded to some other things like sports memorabilia sales, just then the hand of God and different things. What are we kind of seeing in the market right now?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah so what is happening here is that the buyers and investors in these particular assets are extremely educated and they know exactly what they need that asset to have for it to be effectively a one of one, or a really big momentous moment. So the hand of God whatever the 9.3 million for that jersey, it makes absolute sense because it doesn't matter what what you do in life or what your interest in life, you know Diego Maradonna is and we know about that moment, and it's not particularly you know, a positive you know, it is a moment that that has a lot of controversy attached to it. And that just makes it a great asset, which is why that value makes sense. And it shows you the capability of some of these assets. You know, the Kobe Bryant rookie jersey is the one that sold for 3.6 and one that sold for 2.6, 2.7 photo matched rookie moment, rookie Jersey, obviously the passing of Kobe has helped those jerseys as well, rest in peace. But it just shows you that people really know what they want, it has to have every single parameter. If you had a photo of I mean, the Hodges who got the jersey from Maradonna is obviously proof a very good provenance, but there's no photo of Diego Maradonna giving the jersey to him, but it's obviously that the exact jersey because it's photo matched, and it was a very easy photo match and a great photo match. But it was such a unique moment. It was easy, but had Diego Maradonna signed that jersey or if there was an image of him, not being able to really speak English and Hodges saying hey, pointing Give me your jersey if that was documented it would be even more valuable. Similar to the Kobe jerseys, if there were other attributes that made it more unique, and that made the story more clear, the value just goes up, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think what's going on the market is people are really buying meaningful stuff. I mean, I can speak more. I think my knowledge is definitely more expert on the memorabilia side. And as a game used memorabilia side, and I think that's what's happening there. And in my view on the card market, is that people are getting more educated on what actual rarity is. And, you know, I think, game used, and cards, there's definitely a vintage, historic and kind of modern market. As always, with cards, I do just think, by default, the vintage market will always be more valuable. But obviously, as time surpasses, you know, the new market becomes vintage, and it will gradually grow. But there are giants in the sports world, and they've been the same giants for many, many years, even with, you know, Kobe Bryant is a good example. And I think, as I said, that's why I said his passing has added value to those particular jerseys.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the Michael Jordan, rookie jersey, you know, if there was a photo match one it would be significantly more valuable than that. And I think a lot of the collectors in the sports space would agree to that. I know Michael Jordan is still alive, but he's not going to create any more of those moments. I mean, I've seen, I've recently seen an amazing asset, which I can't wait until it comes to the market, but I've seen his playoff, his first playoff rookie shoes. And it's\u0026nbsp;a really great photo match. And if, you know, if a Kobe Jersey sells for $3.6 million, I can see when a shoe like that comes to market or just explode that particular value, because it's such an iconic shoe. And it's his very first playoff and it was used in like two or three of the game. So yeah, I think people want the big pieces, the big investment, the big pieces, this is helping the medium and lower side of the market. But I do think that side of the market will stabilize a bit more, and the value will be very clear to everybody. But yeah, so I think what's going on, I think education is going to be key in terms of estimating the values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, awesome. Okay, cool. I'm going to ask you one more quick question, because I know that we're running over. And I think I think it's such a great point that you make about education. And it's great to hear that, like, as the market is maturing that people, you know, they're getting more educated, they're getting more knowledgeable about these assets. And it's such a great time for the public, for our audience to then kind of come into these categories as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy final question for you was, you spoke about Maradonna, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. These are obviously like Pantheon all time, great athletes, right? When you look at the current kind of crop of athletes who are playing now, are there any that you look at and you think, once they're kind of game used, game worn memorabilia kind of gets out there in the future, it could rival in terms of the sale price? It could kind of rival what we've seen with like, the MJ assets or the Kobe assets or the marathoner assets. Are there any kind of athletes that you look at that will do that?,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah I definitely think they have potential to get up there. This is the will in the basketball world. The Lukas and the Steph Currys, they will get up there. The one thing I will say for the modern athletes, basketball and other sports, is that their game-issued items are much more abundant. So they will be just a much larger supply that also applies to cards as well as a huge supply of modern cards. I do think they can get up there but they literally have to check every single box it would have to be highest scoring game, best playoff run you know you won't really have many multi game worn stuff because of the abundance of the jerseys and stuff for example, but yeah there are definitely are players that will get up there in basketball and football I'm trying to think. Well obviously the Nemars and Mbappes of the world will get up there because there's a direct link there to the Messies and the Ronaldos and the Van Bastens of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think more of what would be the thing to look out for is the gods of the other sports where less focus is currently on at the moment. Those are the ones that will come up I think. I mean, I do honestly think basketball will always be Michael Jordan and then the Kobes and LeBrons and the other greats. Boxing will always be, you know, Mike Tyson. You know, the F1 Racing market will always be Schumacher. You know, Lewis Hamilton and Verstappen will be up there, you know, but everybody's going to want to go back to Schumacher. But I think with education and people understanding all the parameters that they're interested in and getting that real one of one meaningful moment, those will be the athletes we need to look out for that will just jump up there. So not necessarily specifically.. well, obviously, they have to be very good athletes in whatever sport they play, but it will be that one of one, this really unique story that makes them valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eSuper, super insightful.
