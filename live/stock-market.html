For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="../disclosures/Public-Fee-Schedule-07.01.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

What is he big picture for Nintendo's business?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. They were founded in 1865, I think 1865 or 1869, I always get the year mixed up. And they were like a trading card company. And they kind of invented that in Japan, and you know, muddle along, made money and discovered video games in the 70s with arcade style games. So many people, I'm not sure very many of your viewers have actually ever played an arcade game in an arcade, but Donkey Kong was their first giant hit. And it was Mario running up a ramp and avoiding barrels being thrown by the gorilla who is Kong. So Donkey Kong was Mario trying to get past Kong, and get through all the levels and ultimately, free Princess Peach from being kidnapped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat allowed them to generate a lot of wealth, and they decided that they were going to bring the arcade experience to the home. So they're one of the early home console makers, Atari actually might have beat them to it. There's another company Colico, another company in television, all of them watch consoles around the same time in the 80s. And Nintendo’s was the most popular of the many consoles launched - the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. And I think that the reason that their console worked and the other guys didn't, is that Nintendo had content, that is, Mario to start. They kept expanding their content library, and they've launched consoles since 1990. The Super NES 1997 in ‘64. In 2001, the GameCube. In 2006 The Wii, which was enormously popular. Then they did the Wii U in 2013, which was terrible. And then the Switch in 2017, which has been very good. They've had a ton of handhelds. The Gameboy was the original, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Advance SP, the DSX you know, and then the 3DS before the switch. If any of your viewers have watched the new Apple TV plus movie, Tetris, that's actually the story of how the Tetris Company was formed, and the key was getting on the Gameboy. So the Nintendo platform was so popular that these guys were minting money. But at the same time, they've developed about 30 different big brands on the Nintendo platform that they own. So among them Zelda and Kirby, and the Smash Brothers Mario Kart, and so Mario is the biggest one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTheir strategy has really not changed much in the last 40 years. They've been focused on the console and their strategy is to create proprietary software meaning software they own for their proprietary console, so the only way you can play their game is to buy their console. And the other guys aren't that way, Sony and Microsoft have consoles, their total sales of first party, their own IP are under 10% of their total revenue. So, you know, Nintendo is more like north of 50 - it has been as high as 80%. So Nintendo has a different strategy than the other guys. And the departure recently from that strategy, which is not meaningful, but it's interesting is that they really started to focus on licensing their IP, and getting opportunities elsewhere. So you start to see them on mobile a bit. They're not really good at it yet. But again, they only own 31% of Pokemon Company, Pokemon Go, it's been a giant mobile title. But the big, big change lately is this Mario Brothers movie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the Super Mario movie is really driving a lot of awareness of the brand. And if you roll back, again, you're probably about 1. But back in 2000, there were surveys of the most recognizable brands of the 20th century. And you can look this up to this, this is findable on Google, the number one brand ahead of Coca Cola, you know ahead of anything else was Nintendo. So they are the most recognized brand on the planet. And yet, you know, their cumulative console sales, maybe have hit 250 million households, I don't think that could possibly be even close to a billion households. Yet, there are 3or 4 billion people on the planet who know what Nintendo is.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the recent strategy shift has been to license the content to other media, like movies, to get even more awareness of the brand. I think you're going to start seeing, you know, Nintendo lunch pails, lunch boxes for the kids, Nintendo pajamas, you know, Nintendo plush toys. And I think that'll work. And ultimately, what that does is drive greater awareness and more interest in the brand, which will help them sell software and hardware. So they do great. They're making tons of money, the hardware sales spiked during COVID. And they've kind of pulled back lately, but we're talking about the difference between, you know, 21-22 million hardware units down to maybe 19, or 20. So it's not like they got cut in half - they just peaked. And now they've plateaued. I don't see a lead up anytime soon. They're due for product refresh. They haven't launched a new console in a while. So probably next year, there should be a Switch 2 or something, some upgraded Switch. And Nintendo has been pretty smart on the hardware side. They try to build their hardware and sell it at a profit so they tend to use commodity components rather than cutting edge technology. If you look at Sony and Microsoft, they both lose money on every console, Nintendo makes money on every console. So as a consequence, their consoles are less powerful than the other two. But their content is great so it doesn’t seem to matter to their fans.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. And I think you bring up a really important point here, which is this idea that, you know, licensing IP, I think, for most of these companies that we're talking about, but not Nintendo specifically, I imagine the margins can be much higher on licensing IP than they can be on creating technology, creating software and hardware that require a lot of inputs that require a lot of very brilliant minds. And also a lot of parts to be made. You know that that is something that I don't want to discount here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut getting a little bit more into this idea of how important IP is for Nintendo as a company. Talk to me a little bit more about this. The Super Mario Brothers movie released in North America in early April pulled in around $380 million in its opening weekend, which is way I think out of you know, outperformed a lot of the expectations that were placed out there for this film. It was co-financed by Nintendo and Universal Pictures, how many more big, you know, major scaled projects like that, like a Super Mario Brothers movie do you see coming for Nintendo? You know, is this setting a new precedent for the company in terms of licensing IP or the project is going to be as big as you know, a major film release that blew expectations out of the water? Do you expect more of that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe economics aren't clear, and I know that the companies announced that the film was co-financed, but my understanding is that Nintendo didn't put any money in. Instead, they contributed the intellectual property obviously, and they lent technical talent so they let their creative developers Miyamoto, who is the head of their studios, to the project to ensure that the characters had brand integrity that they did.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you have Mario with five arms or or 10 fingers on each hand, and I think that it's likely that their net net profit on this will be something around, you know, 10% of the total film gross, which is still a big number, this film is going to do $2 billion, when they're all done, I mean, between box office and, and all the different DVD sales and pay per view and streaming service fees and licensing to broadcast TV. So they'll make a couple 100 million dollars, that's enough to get them interested in doing it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAgain, this is one of the bigger projects for Universal. And this is the biggest animated film opening I think of all time. So Universal certainly is going to be interested in doing more and more of this. And for Universal, they make even more money, obviously, because they own the animation studio. So they're going to want to do more and more and more. And there'll be a balance, I think that Nintendo doesn't want to over saturate the market. And they certainly don't want to have any brand failures. But I would expect that you'll see another film within three years. I don't think it's going to be annual for a while.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt takes a lot to be like Disney and put out, you know, a Marvel film every three months, which they do. I don't think Nintendo is there yet. Could they get to one a year in the next 10 years? Sure. So it's a nice profit contributor, but the bigger impact of the film is just brand awareness that, you know, they end up having, say 500 million people see the film, you know, at most half of those people are Nintendo current customers and the other half are not. And ultimately they're going to win over a whole generation of people who are going to be interested. And it also opens up the opportunity for them to sell, you know, figurines.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs an example, when the Mandalorian came out, I bought my wife a couple of Growgu characters, and we hadn't seen the show yet. She's like, Why do I want these? And now she thinks they're super cute.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo if Disney's brilliant at Merchandising, and Nintendo has not been. And I expect that Nintendo will get brilliant at merchandising, I think that could open up another couple of 100 million a year of profit. So I can see this company really building on the success of the Super Mario movie, but I can't tell you that they'll do anything for the next two or three years.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Totally, totally. And to your point, you know, the pace with which a company like Disney can put out movies in a franchise like Marvel is astounding. And you know, every single actor in Hollywood these days is somehow tied to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is wild. But with that in mind, it brings to I think, this conversation the the concept of going back to things that work versus creating a new idea or following some sort of new potential concept idea, or content idea or content concept, you know, when we think about Super Mario Brothers has been around to your point where it's being introduced to a new generation, but it was around for my generation, for the younger people in the generation ahead of me, you know that this not really a new franchise.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the same goes with Zelda. I know that there's a big release in the Zelda franchise happening next month that a lot of gaming creators are really excited for. But how important is it for Nintendo to come up with the next Mario or the next Zelda? Is that something that you think companies like Nintendo or even Nintendo itself are considering? Or are they really doubling down on returning to what they know works and adding new elements to those franchises that do work versus trying to come up with, you know, totally brand new ideas - blank white sheet of paper trying to figure out what's next?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, it's a great question. I don't see Nintendo innovating on their existing brands, you will see them create new brands like Animal Crossing, but new that probably is 10 years old. So it's not like that. That's something they did this past year, in the last 20 years. I doubt that they've done more than two big new brands. They have, I counted not for this interview I counted for another reason, there are 30 brands at Nintendo that have sold multiple millions of units of games. So they have 30 established franchises. I promise you Marvel doesn't have 30. I mean, we think that they have 4000 characters, but they don't have 30 brands. And, you know, Disney's managed to do something with that. DC doesn't have 30. You know, but the difficulty in exploiting those brands is, you know, that you have to create a fun, compelling story around them. And I think with 30 brands, Nintendo's got plenty to continue to pump out, you know, three or four big games a year, movies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's interesting because some brands are really great movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, where the brand itself as a comic book wasn't that big a deal. I mean, it was popular but I don't think anybody in this room, I'd say fewer than 10% of the people who are aware of the Guardians of the Galaxy brand will ever have seen the comic book. They learned about the brand from the movie. And that's the right way to build brands, you know that you don't have to build the brand on the comic book.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo an Animal Crossing movie might be good, or a Yoshi Island movie might be good. But we'll definitely get another Animal Crossing game. And we'll definitely get another Yoshi’s Island game. And as I said, there's so many of them that, you know, I don't think Nintendo has to worry about new IP anytime soon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotally - and Animal Crossing. I can't help but ask your perspective on the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on Nintendo as a business and how Animal Crossing became enormous. People were stuck at home, everybody wanted a Nintendo Switch, they were actually incredibly difficult to get for a time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm curious about how the you know, coming out of the the thick of the COVID 19 pandemic might impact how Nintendo moves forward knowing that they did have this this significant moment in the sun, I would say especially with the switch, which I believe is in its seventh fiscal year next, year heading into its seventh fiscal year next year. So it's not a brand new product, you mentioned that you're expecting some sort of a refurbish or a refresh.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow do you think Nintendo is going to rise to the occasion to make sure that you know now that everybody is kind of going back to their regular lives, not really at home quite as much, what is Nintendo going to do to make sure that those people want to buy the next generation of a switch?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e: Yeah, I mean, one of the things Nintendo has pioneered and yet failed to exploit adequately is the concept of user generated content. So they've created these Super Mario Maker software packages that allow you to create your own characters and do your own thing. Animal Crossing, let you do that, you can customize your character. And so when I say they pioneered it and failed to exploit, there were brands that were building things inside Animal Crossing. So you could literally wear Burberry, Burberry sweater, or carry a Louis Vuitton bag. And yet, Nintendo failed to exploit that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo they didn't create a storefront and let you know, only allow the brand to create the Burberry sweater and then let the brand sell you the sweater. And can you imagine if you could buy a Burberry sweater in the game for $1? You know, Burberry would have made 20 million bucks. And why not? Like how does that hurt them? You know, it has 20 million people, you know, wearing their sweater, it helps us. So I think Nintendo is smart. I think their management team is smart. I like the current CEO a lot.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe'll get that right in the next iteration. So that'll be fun. I think that again, who knows what they're going to do with that next generation switch. But if they allow more creator tools, and they allow you more interoperability, so maybe create something and broadcast that TikTok video or Twitch video through your console, which Sony allows you to do now, I think you get a lot more creative talents. And if you open up the opportunity to create to everybody, you end up enriching the world because you end up with something like America's Got Talent or American Idol, where you get these amateurs who are really talented, and they turn into superstars, you know, so Carrie Underwood, came out came off of a farm in Oklahoma and is a star. And it's hard to know that she would have been discovered but for the opportunity for amateurs to compete, you know, in public.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think Nintendo exploits that type of concept, and let's amateurs create within the switch to universe. I think they'll come up with really great content, and I think there's an opportunity to make money.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, incredibly interesting. Who's the Carrie Underwood for Nintendo is a fun question to ponder here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo Michael, I want to talk for a second here about risks and sort of the future, we’ll future cast just a little bit here. You have an outperform rating for Nintendo shares said in a recent report that the stock presents a favorable risk reward profile. I would love to hear you explain that just a little bit and talk to me a little about the risks that might materialize for Nintendo in the medium and long term.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey're a pretty dependable company. So they're pretty easy to forecast. Their hardware sales, as I said, don't vary by more than 10% either way. So the odds of them forecasting 20 million switch sales coming in at 10, that's pretty close to zero. They forecast 20 that comes in at 18, they're not going to be thrown from profit to loss, they're going to make a little less money. And it's just as likely that it goes from 20 million to 22. They still have the tool in their pocket of price cuts, and they haven't cut the price much if at all. They've introduced three now three models of the switch, they have the switch light, the regular switch, and the switch OLED.\u0026nbsp; I could see them cutting the price of each of those by 50 bucks, and suddenly you would see sales go up. And they'll still make money because the cost of manufacture and shipping has gone way down as the supply chain has gotten more normal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I really say low, low low risk on hardware. Software is more a function of release schedule. So you know, if they release a new game, every three months, they're fine. If they miss one, and it takes six months, they might not make as much profit as we forecast. And if they missed two or three, and we go a year or two without, without a new software title, that's a problem. But they've been pretty dependable since the Switch launch that I've seen them really miss anything. You know, delaying Zelda, a few months doesn't matter. That's time value of three months of cash, it's not that big a deal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I'd say risks are very, very low. The reward opportunity, you know, the upside is that when they cut price, they surprise us with a better lineup. And we get more software sales. You know, Zelda is not the best selling game of all time, you know, Mario Kart is, the big surprise for upside would be that there's a Mario Kart 9. You know, which the last Mario Kart I think came out in 2014. It's been a long, long time. So they're really due for something like that. That could be huge. And I would guess that that's their next movie. And so I would guess that you're going get Mario Kart game and Mario Kart movie kind of at the same time. And, and that's where I think they surprise the upside. So I, there's more opportunity for them to beat than there is for them to miss.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. All right. So Michael, this has been wonderful. I have one last question for you for the road. Before we wrap things up here. Just while I have you, Roblox. I would love to get your perspective. Your take on Roblox recently reported monthly key metrics for March that perhaps fell a bit short of expectations. I know you have a neutral rating and a $37 price target for that stock. What are your general thoughts just quickly on Roblox as a company right now,\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey, you know, they don't disclose their monthly active users, but the number is around 300 million. And that's not even close to saturation. I mean, they could get to a billion users. But the way to do that is to expand the product offering to appeal to people older than 20. And I don't mean to suggest that their content isn’t good, it is. It's just that as you age, you're much more interested in shooter games like Call of Duty, or, you know, role playing games like World of Warcraft.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so the way to get that type of content is to expand the platform. And the way to expand the platform is to rev share at a higher rate for recognizable content. I think they can. And I actually like their management. And I think that they know that they need to do this, but they haven't done it yet. So I don't see this company getting to the growth implied by its share price until they shift the business model, share more of the revenue with developers and attract games that appeal to older people. And you know, they have a couple of quarters of stagnant growth. That's really what's going on there. The growth is okay, but not as good as people expected. If they have a couple of quarters, stagnant growth, I expect that they'll make a shift. So I'm waiting until it happens. I guess I could forecast the exact date it will happen, but I don't know. If we see an indication that they're going to change them, then we obviously will look at them more favorably, but I haven't seen that yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. All right. Well, we'll just have to check back in at a later date. Michael, this has been so wonderful. Thank you so much for your time and all of your incredible insights. I've really enjoyed this conversation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you, Kinsey.

All right, folks. Let's do it. A very cool topic on a very timely day for it and well, we're joined by Mark Mahaney, Senior Managing Director at Evercore ISI, the research division to talk all things Amazon and like I said, what a day for it. Amazon entering the generative AI race through AWS with the introduction of bedrock you may have seen in the headlines the last few hours. It's set to allow clients to leverage and customize AI tools to generate text similar to the way the Chat GPT does. And Mark Mahaney is here who else better to talk about it. We'll also talk a little bit of tech preview as well ahead of earnings season. Mark, thanks for being here. Nice to have you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eGood to be here. Thanks for including me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. I do need to embarrass you just a bit with a plug. For people who don't know, Mark is also the author of a new book – it’s called “Nothing But Net: 10 Timeless Stock-Picking Lessons from One of Wall Street’s Top Tech Analysts,” and we are doing book giveaways here at Public. So, if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the Public live handle. Okay, Mark, thank you for being here. First, congrats on the book, I first want to just get your takeaway for the shareholder letter. It's always nice to hear from Andy Jassy. What most stood out to you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat most stood out is that, like every year, this is kind of a thoughtful review of what's happened to the company over the last year and what their current priorities are for the next year – I know that sounds really basic. I think all CEOs should write shareholders like this. In the book I went through the first 25 first years of the Bezos shareholder letters, and I pulled out key themes from each year. There was a dramatic focus on customer satisfaction and a dramatic focus on innovation – and you kind of still see that here today. But, if there were a couple of new themes that really stuck out, cost – focused on cost efficiencies, and there's a series of items in this letter about how they looked at all of their businesses, whether it was AWS, retail, both international and in the US, their advertising business, the layoffs and just kind of a recognition that demand trends have softened, and they needed to tighten their belts. And so that was one – that was new. I mean, I think you would have seen this in 08-09, you know, back during the great financial crisis, but we haven't had a shareholder letter focus on cost reductions and cost efficiency, so it's a sign of the times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then I think the second area had to do with innovations in each of the segments. So, in retail, they have sped up deliveries and they talked about Prime deliveries should be at their fastest pace this year like if you're ordering Amazon retail products via Prime, you should get the product faster this year to your home, to your apartment, wherever than you did in the past, that's a good investment. They also tease some of these improvements that you also teased on the AWS side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the third point is just a reminder that Amazon's actually been aggressively investing in machine learning and artificial intelligence, you know, for the better part of a decade, and it's in there in terms of the product announcements, the the product feed, or the recommendations that they've given, and it's been in there in terms of the AWS products, the bedrock announcement is a little different. But you know, it's a different level, it’s different scale, but the investments have been there – and so I think they kind of also wanted to use a shareholder letter, Andy did, just to kind of raise his hand and say, “Hey, I know we didn't talk about the last earnings call, but we actually are a machine learning and AI company and by the way, we have been for a decade.” So I thought those were the three most interesting things in the shareholder letter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we also heard him on that last earnings call as well, which I think all of us that listen in on those sorts of things, we want to hear from someone in that position. We haven't historically, and we don't always from big companies. So that's worth noting as well. I wonder, before we move on, was there anything with regards to macro concerns to how the company is positioned for high interest rates? I don't know that we would hear much directly with concerns over tightening credit or potential credit crunch like we do a lot of other companies, but anything you think, for people to know, in terms of potential way, big picture headwinds for the company?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't think so. The line in here that I'm staring at now is, “While the short term headwinds soften our growth rate, we'd like a lot of funnels now fundamentals that we're seeing at AWS.” So they're acknowledging the short term headwinds, right up front, and they should, because you know, if you step back on AWS, this was a 30% year-over-year revenue grower up until the middle of last year, and now in this March quarter that they're going to print in two to three weeks, the dates not set yet, they're going to print something like 12 13%, like the growth rates have been cut in half in in a year's time, that's always something that's a little bit alarming, and for any company, but I think it's very much a reflection of softening macro environment. And then what Amazon is doing, or AWS is doing to respond to that, which is they're aggressively going after and bringing down pricing in order to help their customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eSo you mentioned, it seems as if the company was pretty eager to remind people to say, hey, we're still here in the AI conversation, folks who really haven't gotten anywhere, obviously, much of the chatter may sort of be dominated by other names in the space. But talk to me more about what we learned about bedrock specifically, and any other thoughts, Mark that you have, as they look to integrate it into its cloud offering, certainly a big priority for the company at a really important time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, unlike Microsoft, and Google, Amazon's not going to have a generative AI LLM – “Large Language Model” out there. But what they are doing is AWS’ bread and butter has always been selling to devs. What I mean by that is developers, the people who create the large language models, and so they're just that that's kind of what they're doing with bedrock, which is saying that they're rolling out more tools to help LLM developers GAI, that's Generative AI developers, build their models build their tools, that just reminding people that, you know, they, there are tools provider, that's where they're playing in this, this AI race, in addition to doing normal things like storage and compute for their customers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I don't know if that's helpful or not, you're going to see them kind of in the weeds on generative AI and in the weeds on LLMS,\u0026nbsp;allowing developers, creators to create and develop those models, rather than, you know, running the flashy front-end consumer service. So that's also why they'll probably be somewhat under-appreciated in terms of their AI competencies. I just think the broad point is, Amazon's fully involved in AI. They've been using it to improve their processes, they've been using artificial intelligence for everything from book selections to you to where in a warehouse where they actually put products so that they can most quickly have people or robots pick up those products and put them in packages and ship them off to you. And then they use it for advertising and they use that in AWS. So that's just a reminder, because I think maybe the market needed one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, well, to that point, do you think the company almost deserves more credit or deserves to be more a part of the active chat GPT AI adjacent conversation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, they do. But you need to think about them as a company that’s already been investing in machine learning and AI for their core operations. And then when it comes to large language models, which is what Chat GPT is, they're the company – that’s who open AI will use. Actually, I don't know if they use AWS, but the other open AIs because there's a lot of other large language models and applications being built, they'll be built or a substantial percentage of them will be built on AWS. So AWS is kind of the tools vendor, the picks and shovels vendor, to the AI community, to the generative AI community. That's something that I think the market had kind of forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. Andy Jassy said this morning on Squawk he doesn't focus too closely on the company's stock price. What did data say – it's currently up 4.4%, with under two hours left in training here, you have an outperform rating, if I'm not mistaken, you recently lowered your own price target to 155 from 160. Again, with a bump today, it's trading right around 102. Talk to me about your decision to bid more, Mark, to drop that target and are you still finding yourself being positive for a long term case?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I can be near term cautious. I do think what he's saying in the shareholder letter, and he's warning people, is that trends are softening\u0026nbsp;even at AWS. And, you know, the facts of the facts, we've had a dramatic deceleration and growth rate, you know, you go from 30% to 10% revenue growth in a year, year and a half. That's not healthy, that's not bullish. And I think that things are likely to get worse at AWS before they get better, but they will get better. And, and for long term investors, which is what I really pitch people to be on Amazon, I pitched that you'd think about Amazon in 2023, is what I would call a DHQ stock, that's the concept that's in my book a “Dislocated High Quality” stock. Another way to think about it is it's a trough multiple stock on trough earnings. And you know, it's cyclical. And as these companies get bigger and bigger, of course, they're more cyclical, you can't escape the economy if you become a bigger, bigger contributor to it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what I think is so interesting about the setup on Amazon is, there may be a little disappointment about AWS results in the March quarter, or the June quarter guide, but we're going to get revenue growth acceleration as we go into ‘24, for their advertising, business, retail business, and for AWS, and you're going to get margin expansion and improvement and free cash flow. And I'm telling you all that when the stock is sitting here at a multi-year, multiple or trough multiple, a low multiple, and so that's, you know, that's the time when you step in, and you can make money, you may even be dealing with volatility over the next quarter. I don't know that there's a ton of downside volatility, but there'll be some. And I think if you're willing to look out a year, I think this is a great time to buy Amazon shares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't want to pull the conversation away from Amazon, but I'm hoping quickly, can you talk to us more about DHQs and any other household names people may be familiar with and why they fit that mold?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eGoogle is another one I think that fits that DHQ category. The old saying in the market says buy low, sell high, and I'm kind of saying buy high low. So you know, find a high quality company measured, you know, the book goes through it, but measured on the how good the management team is, how good the level of product innovation is at the company, how large the market opportunities, find those high quality companies and just wait for them to get dislocated, because they all get dislocated because there are market rollovers. That's obviously what we faced in Texas last year. There are mis-executions, because no company is perfect and they’ll make mis-executions. And then when you get those pull backs in the stock, that's when you step in, but first find a high quality company and I'll just take my reputation as I have historically that Amazon is one of those I think Google is to and it seems to me like the fears, you know, the near term and long term fears are well overstated on both of these names. I think they're both very good franchises so those would be two. You know, you can buy at a multiple, you can buy Google and Amazon at about the cheapest multiples you've had a chance to buy at in the last five years. I don't think you're going to regret buying both of those stocks here as DHQ opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eI have all potential opportunities for Amazon, whether it's logistics, groceries, health care, talk to me about what you personally are most excited about. What do you think makes the most impact? Or is it something that maybe we haven't even yet discussed, Mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let me check off some items or count them out. People talking about what Amazon is doing in healthcare - that's always been a head scratcher for me.\u0026nbsp;I'm just not convinced that – I think that's a huge market, but doesn't mean that Amazon should be going into it, so I'm skeptical about that. So I just want to start off with what I'm skeptical about.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I'm positive about is I think they can be a lot bigger and advertising now that they've just got a lot more content. All of their advertising, most of their advertising revenue so far has come from sponsored ads within their shopping results. But if they start putting advertisements against all of that premium content, video content that they have, I think that's a segment of the business that can double in the next five years, their advertising business. And then I want to get a little bit more blue sky, I talked about this, that logistics business, that buy with Prime. I mean, that's the FedEx competitor, that's the UPS competitor, and I'm pretty damn sure that Amazon's going after that, and it's tiny, tiny, tiny for them now, but I think that its low margin business, but Amazon knows how to handle its low margin businesses, I think that's going to be one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the last one I'd point to is business and industrial supplies. And I think what Amazon's vision here is to, is to connect the world's factories with the world's consumers, and, the world's factories with the world's businesses and people under-appreciate that latter one. And so it's industrial supplies, business supplies, look, Amazon's got the fulfillment network out there. They've got vans and people who deliver products to consumers, it's just a different stop. Now, there's a lot of other things that go into getting into procurement cycles for businesses. But I think that that's a big opportunity. I'm actually surprised they're not figuring that now. So that to me, is kind of one of the sleepers. So, the big sleepers for me are that, advertising and then that logistics business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eReal quick, not the most important question I'm going to ask you, but what's your favorite show on Amazon Prime since you mentioned content? I ask the important stuff, Mark. I'm a very serious journalist, you know me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eI think you've got me. I can tell you what my favorite books that I've been reading on Amazon Kindle. I'm not much of a movie person. You asked the wrong guy. I apologize.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, no –\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003efair enough. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Lots of good book options as well. Let me ask you about earnings season, of course, right around the corner. In your last note or a recent note, rather, you say you are tactically constructive. Talk to us more about that line of thinking, what you would want people to know, and some of the key factors that are driving that particularly out there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so we're making four points. One is that multiples have been de-risked. estimates have been de-risked. What we've had are all these job cuts, you know, cost actions, as painful as they are, over the last year, over the last six months really, these intense rounds of layoffs and, and cuts that's created what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. This is the third reason why we're more tactically constructive – because when eventually revenue growth really accelerates it is going to do it on a lower cost base. So that means you're going to get a real launch, or slingshot when it comes to earnings. And then the fourth reason why we're tactically constructive, or really constructive is AI. I think there's a lot of opportunities for digitally savvy companies and I think there's a fair number of them in the internet space, to take advantage of AI models and really create something interesting. So I think there are these reasons and so then I'll just end up with what stocks do we like? Well, our number one pick here is meta. Number two pick is Uber. And number three pick is Netflix. Those are 2023 stock picks. If I'm willing to look longer than that, I'm definitely throwing Amazon and Google into the mix.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eNice. Sounds good. That's a great perspective from the great Mark Mahaney, senior Managing Director at Evercore ISI research division. Mark, I encourage you to check out at least a few shows on Amazon Prime. Good stuff there, my man. Thanks for taking the time. Great to get your perspective,Mark. Thanks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney \u003c/strong\u003eThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin\u003c/strong\u003e And a reminder to those of you listening at home, Mark of course is the author of the new book titled “Nothing But Net: 10 Timeless Stock-Picking Lessons from One of Wall Street’s Top Tech Analysts,” and is he ever.

So this is 2023. New Year, new time. The last few years, you know just to recap, luxury really skyrocketed during COVID luxury products are the most experiential of all products. And while people were locked in, unable to travel, unable to eat out their lives somewhat constrained, they sought luxury products and a lot of people had additional income because you weren't spending on experiences. So luxury became the new experience. And in fact, the luxury market captured a lot of new consumers. As we ended 2022, there's still you know, in America, there's a lot of pent up demand for travel. We were traveling last year to Europe where you saw lots of luxury purchases transpire in Europe, where in 2021, many of them, and in 2020, they occurred in the US market. The U.S. market took over as the number one market in the last few years where it had been like China are the number one consumers it moved to America. We've seen a lot of shifting happen in the last few years. So as we enter this year, you have a shift back to experiences which consumers want to have, they want to travel and travel has inflationary prices of 25 to 50%. Consumers want to eat out, there's inflation across the board, and the economy is somewhat weakening. So that's one backdrop that's happening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the same time, though, you have the China market opening up. We saw that happen in February. China was really under a lockdown last year so luxury really suffered. So as the Chinese began to travel domestically, and then as this year and next year progressed internationally, they will resume their – we assume they'll resume their love affair with all things luxury. So the big things as we head into this year are the pace of the reopening of China post the pandemic and what was a dampened demand for China for luxury by the Chinese is that resume. And then what's happening in the U.S. economy, there's mounting job losses with the Vigilant fed fighting inflation. The stock market is volatile, and these are factors that impact consumer sentiment and their willingness to spend on discretionary purchases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut as I said, during COVID, we got a lot of new luxury shoppers. It's projected that by 2030, about 75% or more of all luxury purchases will be made by millennials and younger. You have a lot of people that discovered luxury and luxury is sticky. Luxury is better quality. It romances people. It impacts the way people think about themselves. And we believe that they'll be trading down in some more commodity type products, like in the brown beans that you buy, maybe in the jeans that you buy.\u0026nbsp; In apparel, we see a trade down, but luxury we think has stickiness. That said, you know, if you lose your job, you're not going to be buying luxury products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Let's talk about stickiness, mobile, let's also talk about it in the context of pricing. I feel as though there are constantly these articles being published about how Rolex watches Hermes bags, have seen prices skyrocket under the guise of inflation in part but also because demand seems to have gone up from these new demographics. Can you talk about how price sensitive or not luxury is? Not all luxury is created equal if you break it down by category for us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e No, no. So not all luxury is created equal and I mean, the real trick of luxury and really any product category is to best match supply and demand. With luxury you want to have demand outpacing supply. And that's what happened during COVID. More people wanted an Hermes handbag or wanted an Hermes bracelet. Then Hermes was able to meet that demand. Some of it was supply chain constraints, and some of that there were more people entering the market that wanted these things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou also see that in resale if you're a student of the markets, you see that resale has provided pricing transparency into your first purchase. So you could buy a Hermes handbag newer or\u0026nbsp; Louis Vuitton handbag new and see that in the aftermarket, you can get 80 to 150% of what you paid for. So it's brought a new kind of shopper into the market. Also, if you buy in consignment it is where you can often meet that need for a luxury product today. You don't have to wait six months for it. It's In the aftermarket.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNot all products are equal. Certainly Hermes is, you know, unique in its ability to keep consumers panting for demand of you know their Birkin bag or their Kelly bag. But, and you've seen while Gucci was really driving incredible demand through COVID. By the end of COVID. Really, it became.. it was time to move on to another product. So partly as luxury becomes entwined with high priced designer brands, designer design and fashion are different than true luxury.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd let's talk a little bit about where Hermes and LVMH specifically fall on the luxury pricing spectrum. Marie, do you expect the higher end brands like there to be more recession proof than mid tier luxury brands? I mean, as you look at overall demand as distinct printers, price sensitivity, where do you see those learned?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are two different companies. Hermes has this one brand with sub-brands. Birkin is a brand, but it's really one brand, Louis Vuitton is a company that consists of about 80 different luxury brands. So with LVMH you're getting incredible diversification that spans Sephora and beauty, which is our entry points for luxury and in fact is holding up quite well. DFS, which is another part of their selective retail group. But they have some real winners with Louisville Vuitton and Christian Dior and then they have some more fashion brands like a Kenzo that are more vulnerable to an economy than the LDN, then the Louis Vuitton. And then of course, you have Tiffany's, you have all their jewelry lines.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what we saw in 2008 and 2009, is that luxury did not go down as low as other categories and it rebounded more quickly than other consumer discretionary categories. And we think that that will be the case again, this, you know, in this current economic environment, and frankly, this environment is nowhere near what 2008 or 2009 was with the Great Recession. Right now, like we're not even sure if we're in a recession, right? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnne Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, yes. So I think we're not sure if we're in a recession now and it's much more about the outlook. You've talked about Asia demand. Let's call it something else geopolitically that's different today versus in 2008 and that's the impact on Russian demand for luxury goods. Talk to us a little bit about what demand from Russia has looked like in the past and where it stands now, given the conflict with Ukraine?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So Russia, it is not a support as it was in 2008 or2009. Or, you know, it was part of the picture. But now you have a growing UAE, you have a youth that is entering the luxury market. And so I think that, you know, what's different now is there's more people in the market. We recently presented a Shop talk and in 2000, when we entered this century, 3% of the Chinese were in the middle class, by 2018 53% were. I mean, you have a huge middle class of 700 million people that buy luxury. They may buy low, and they have pent up demand from COVID for the last two years. So that's going to help them this year. The UAE has always sought luxury, but now they're bringing it to their own territory and we see a lot of demand coming there, which will offset the loss of the Russian consumer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTalk to us a little bit too, Marie, about direct to consumer and how luxury has been able to sell online, you know, you think about the stereotypical luxury experience, it's very much in person, it's tactile, you see the product, you feel the product, you try the product, if you're paying such high prices, has that evolved?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo their pricing is consistent, you know, the luxury brands are going direct to consumer because they can, they're in selected points of distribution where they want to be often they're renting space in a wonderful department store like a Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue or Bloomingdale's. But going direct to consumer means that you hope that you have control of your messaging at all points, and your adjacencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDuring COVID we saw and we continue to see throughout America, that luxury brands are opening more direct to consumer out physical stores to be where the consumer is because during COVID many consumers moved from metro areas to urban and rural areas. We just did a survey in China and it's more important for the Chinese that they want to discover luxury in physical store locations. And another interesting facet is that they're influenced more by their friends than they are by a KOL. So I urge you folks to check out Coresight’s research and look for our most recent survey on the China luxury consumer. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut so, but direct to consumer is just a way for them to really control what they look like in every point of sale and online. You can get selected products but luxury, is experiential, as you said, and not all the apparel is going to be or the ready to wear, not all the collection is going to be available online. But it's as easy as during COVID the consumers picked up the phone and call their sales associate. And and they were doing one to one selling kind of like one to one live shopping.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, just to finish our conversation, which has been just so interesting. With respect to Hermes and LVMH in particular, can we just go back to something you touched on early, which was the second hand market? We know that both Hermes and LVMH generate about half their revenue from the leather goods category, which is one secondhand market? And then you've got jewelry and others? Can you talk about the second hand appetite for those different product categories?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so I know better the second hand you know, the RealReal's of the world, the best year collective. A lot of it is the leather goods, you know, if you're a shopper and you love luxury goods and you buy some luxury clothing, you see that it drops, unless it's the most iconic of pieces, it drops in value, like 50 to 80%. The handbags hold their value, as I said before, and you get 80 to 150% of what you pay for. The thing about the secondhand market is that you can attract a new consumer to your brand there. A lot of brands, luxury, contemporary are bringing resale on their own branded platform so that they can keep that connection with the consumer. And there's been advances in technology and tagging so that luxury brands can keep track of who owns their product.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll this is to say that secondhand is really very viable. A luxury shopper cares about sustainability. And this secondhand is a feature of sustainability. It shows a prolonged life, it validates a purchase and it validates quality, something that has an extended life. An interesting feature that has come out with the recent RealReal report is that consumers are looking for vintage products and they're looking for handbags that are in fair condition, not necessarily in excellent condition because they want a handbag with the patina of use, which is really interesting. They want to look like they've owned this handbag for 10 years not for you know the last month. Interesting, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat is very interesting.\u0026nbsp; And part of my last question, which comes to mind if you can get your crystal ball out for us, Marie, and look at the next six to 12 months out? How do you see that trend evolving? And what are some other evolving consumer and luxury retail trends you can see coming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I think luxury holds up. I think that, you know, depending on how bad the economy is, you will see an impact. It's more muted in luxury but it you know it does participate in the economy. I think you'll see perhaps people trading into second hand also monetizing what they have in their closet to support their next luxury purchase.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdditionally, beauty will do well. Beauty has become a form of wellness, it's a form of taking care of oneself. So all the and fragrance has become more important in terms of self expression and taking care of oneself. So I think that we're going to see beauty grow, and you see that caring brings beauty in house. So beauty will become a more important feature of overall luxury and luxury will hold up and luxury has less volatile earnings and they can sooner you know, slow down their manufacturing and again keep their supply demand that equation in balance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWith that Marie Driscoll thank you so much for joining us Senior Analyst at Coresight Research.

We're going to be covering lots of things from The possible TikTok ban and its potential impact. With us today, once again is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. He is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 timeless stop picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts and we are doing a book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public live handle. You see it right there on the top of your screen, folks. All right, it's time to get into it. Hi, Mark. Welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, Kori. Good. Hey, good to hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's good to hear you too. A lot of change actually Mark since I last talked to you. I don't know if you're aware a lot in the financial industry has changed. But today we're gonna focus on the tech stuff and what's happening with TikTok, I mean, the company's CEO, he provided that testimony. He was on Capitol Hill this morning, where he really received some tough, tough criticism with one lawmaker even stating, and I quote, I expect today, you'll say anything to avoid this outcome, but we are not buying it. What were your takeaways from the TikTok CEOs testimony?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that none of my children ever have to go on the Capitol Hill and testify with the weekend that he had, I wouldn't wish that fate on my greatest enemy. So I'm sorry to carry on being kind of glib about it. But that was, you know, I respect him. And I respect him for going up there and taking that, it's kind of like Zuckerberg, you know, in the last year or two or two years ago, being brought up to Capitol Hill to testify. It's kind of like the leaders of tech being brought up there Bezos and, and Tim Cook, etc, are being brought up to testify that was just unfortunately for TikTok, they're going up against two major issues, social health concerns, related to social media usage. And then much more importantly, these days is national security issues. And so, you know, you knew that the question was just how much defense he could play in that time, and I didn't watchall of the testimony. But that's what I was just struck by and I think maybe more importantly, just today's testimony, the action question for all of us as public market investors because we can't invest in TikTok or, or at least not as a separate standalone asset. I don't think we'll ever see it that way, is what are the implications of this for other social media assets, specifically, Snap, Meta, and Google? And I think the probability of TikTok getting banned in the US is just increasing, you know, relatively materially over the last 12 months. I know there are a lot of constitutional issues around this. And I think they're very serious. But I just think that the odds of some sort of ban or major restriction have increased materially. And so that's kind of a pending catalyst. And anytime the news flow comes up, you'll see names like Snap and Meta outperform on that day, which is what you're seeing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel what I'm hacking a little bit more in terms of the broader social media context, because you did reference, you know, Zuckerberg having to go up there kind of, you know, defend all the stuff that Facebook, you know, had going on all the negative things specifically, right, that was happening. I mean, you even saw back in the day with Dorsey, he had to go there. Back when he was still leading his company. He co-founded Twitter. I mean, you see it across the board, it doesn't seem to be net like it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon. And one of my takeaways from what happened today with TikTok, specifically, Mark is that I feel like they're also getting the brunt of all of the aforementioned right, big social media companies. It's like they've had enough time at the batting cage, right? With the Facebooks, with the Googles of the world, with the Snaps that now they're just ready to unleash completely on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori, I think that's right. But no, but don't forget this. I mean, we got a major political issue, growing political tensions between the US and China. And that's what made this tougher, I think, than anything that the tech companies had to face before because, you know, they,Those are US companies, you know, presenting in front of their elected representatives. That's not the case with TikTok and at the moment when relations between the US and China are at the lowest that they've been and, you know, I'm no expert on that. But um, in some time and maybe decades, so it's just, there's just a lot of different angles here that made it much tougher for TikTok to come through and again, it's kind of hard to see a political out here because it looks to look from where I stand it, it looks like the US military has banned Tiktok from personnel devices, personal and personnel devices. You've had more states do that. You've had a federal government do that you'd like that. That's from government-owned devices. So you've already gotten pretty far down the path here. You've never had that happen with any of the other apps. So and that's not because there's a greater social health issue related to TikTok than there was to Snap or to Facebook. It's because of the Chinese national security issue. So that this is just a bigger, this is just my this is more explosive of an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e No, it definitely is something else that you brought up earlier is that you know, you don't think there will ever really see TikTok, as a standalone kind of investable company where people like you or myself, your company would be able to then you know, buy shares in TikTok, it is owned by ByteDance. However, are there some scenarios perhaps in your mind Mark that could play out if TikTok were forced to sell or spin on where it could become, you know, a company at some point that you are I could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well I don't think so. There was an article in the papers this morning in China that the Chinese government for the first time made an official statement that they would be strongly opposed to a forced sale of TikTok. So I mean, I'm no expert on China, I just assumed that there would be some statement that would come out along the way to this effect. Well, it's out. So I think that's why a ban is such a distinct probability, because I don't think ByteDance will be allowed, even if they wanted to, and I don't think they want to, they wouldn't be allowed to sell TikTok to a US company. So TikTok's in the middle of a geopolitical Firestorm that's, it's unfortunate for them. And you know, I give them all credit. This is a highly innovative company now, whether they actually create a national security risk, that's, you know, there are thorough, thoughtful arguments on that. But anyway, that probably matters. Neither here nor less, it doesn't matter now, Kori, we're not gonna be able to get the chance to invest. So let's focus on the companies that could be derivatives of there. That's Meta. Alphabet because of YouTube and Snap. And I really do think sometimes we spend a little too much time on Snap as a derivative. I think that the use case you know, for those who have used TikTok a lot, you think about what other assets like Snap is more of a communications tool than that kind of leaned forward entertainment tool. That TikTok is but the analogies are really, Instagram and YouTube and those would be the beneficiaries where they were TikTok to be banned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, that was a foreign mission company is like Google because of YouTube likes Facebook, obviously, also owns Instagram. This is a perfect lead into my next question, because I know over at Evercore, you guys recently hosted a panel with three experts who collectively oversee $1 billion in ad budgets, these are companies that have really been struggling right in the ad space. But the panel revealed some signs that this ad a winter it could be starting to thaw, could you provide some insight into what you're seeing in the ad space, and how we could you know, positively impact some of those other companies that we could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think we're still in an ad winter, I think that's what we've uncovered so far with, with the channel checks that we've done, maybe that's not terribly surprising. And, you know, there's a broadening consensus that, that we do have a recession coming. So you know, we could be staying in an ad winter for quite some time. I don't think we're going to see crocus's anytime soon. I think Kori, those are the first plants that show up in the snow out of the snow, but you're also into horticulture Mark, you're a man of many talents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e And somebody can correct me on my pronunciation of crocus's. But, but, but I, I don't, I don't think we're gonna get a quick V shape recovery in marketing spend in advertising spend. And so that's going to be a bit of a drag on some of these names. The advantage and one of the reasons we like Meta frankly, one of the reasons it's our number one recommendation is you don't need to believe that to be long Meta, because they've taken so many of the costs out of their business. And then they've got this new reals, monetization, and they're doing much better targeting than they were years ago. And if you've got this new ad format called click to messaging, click the message which is used much less than the US but it's widely used outside of the US especially in areas of the world like Latin America and parts of Asia. And that's, that's a it's a brand new there's like a product cycle here. You need a product cycle because the overall market is getting soft, and it's not good. It's not firming up yet it's not getting better. And we're still in an ad winter and you know, we should probably assume we're gonna continue to be one for as it's gonna be a long winter it's gonna be several more months at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark I don't know. I remember you being this type of pessimistic in terms of the ad winter continuing and then you brought up the dreaded R word recession, goodness, a lot of things in what you just said that are very important takeaways. I'm gonna keep it moving, though, because Amazon, this is a company that has been doing a complete like 180 in terms of its firing, it's not doing the speed hiring anymore. They just announced on Monday, they're gonna lay off another 9000 employees. Do you have any thoughts on this mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think the big backdrop here is actually I thought Amazon was the first of the major tech companies to acknowledge that they had over hired overbuilt during the COVID crisis, they said this on their march 22 earnings call that was the that would have been last April, so about a year ago, but then they didn't really act on it. Whereas I think Facebook didn't acknowledge it early, but then they acted on it by laying off a good number of employees. Look, these layoffs are they're no fun for anybody there painful for all people involved. I've gone through it. And, so I wish it on nobody but you know, just as consumer households have to tighten their belts when times get tough. So do corporations, and especially those that over-hired and over-extrapolated from COVID demand trends. And Amazon was one of those, you could actually look they grew their expenses faster than they grew their revenue, and their revenue grew quickly, from 2019 to 2022. So they did overbuilt, they acknowledged it, and they needed to do one or two rounds of cuts, and they've done the two rounds of cuts. As long as we don't go into a steep recession, I don't think they need to do another round of cuts. But doing those cuts was necessary. You also had a bit of a change in but you've had a major change in management over the last two years. It's given a new CEO who's been with the company for 20 years. So he's not new to Amazon by any means. But it gets given them some time to maybe look through all the portfolio of bets, and assets that Amazon hasn't maybe pair some things back maybe not lose $10 billion a year on Alexa, which was a reported number, which was terrifically high. So anyway, I think I think that's kind of what you're getting out of Amazon, which is they're getting deep now into belt-tightening. And I do think that at the end of the day, when we come out of this, and when we get back to more normal economic times, companies are going to be doing this on the lower cost base. And that means you create what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. So when the revenue recovers on a lower cost base, that means that earnings can grow much faster. And that can be a great long equity opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's definitely hope that it will be really quick, Mark, before I get you out of here. I know that you are recently out in Las Vegas for the PROSPER show, which is a gathering of E-commerce sellers and solution providers just really quickly for all the rest of us who were not able to attend the show. What insights did you take away about the Amazon marketplace from that show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's still remarkably a positive experience for most sellers that are on there. And I think you're seeing a lot of them. I guess one of them the most part, the single most interesting takeaway for me was, I think it was 8 out of the 10. Amazon Marketplace, sellers that we spoke to are currently using advertising on Amazon. And Amazon don't tell anybody this but they're generating close to $40 billion a year in advertising revenue, they're going to be the next $100 billion a year ad revenue company. And that's not going to be next year or the year after. But sometime in the next three to five years. They'll be up there. I mean, they're gonna be in spitting distance of Facebook and Google. And because it's a high-intent platform and marketers and advertisers love to be in high-intent platforms. So that was probably the biggest takeaway. Merchants really like advertising on Amazon, watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow. Well, the faculty said they're going to be in spitting distance of those big behemoths like Google and Facebook. That's definitely something to watch. As always, we love when you come on Public lot to share your insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, the senior managing director and head of internet research team over at Evercore ISI.

All right. Let's do it. Folks. Welcome one and all public live. I'm your host this afternoon. JD Durkin. I'm so happy to be here with all of you today learning about the evolving air transportation space and how Blade is bringing innovation to the world of travel. I am thrilled to welcome our special guests for the afternoon. Will Heyburn the CFO of blade welcome to Public Live. Great to have you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Thanks so much for having me very excited to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Of course my man. It's great to have you. So Blade provides of course air transportation alternatives to pretty congested ground routes. And for those of us who live in New York City, we know that that's basically a daily occurrence. And you bring those alternatives to communities all around the world. Will, help break down Blades passenger segment offering and its value add.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so just real quick, you know, Blade is really focused on those use cases for air mobility that can be profitable today. So we're laser-focused on areas where you have that addressable market of customers where we can save them a tremendous amount of time, for a price that's going to be competitive to ground transportation. As a reminder, we're doing this in an asset-light fashion, we don't own or operate any aircraft. And that's what allows us to grow so quickly expand so quickly, and do it in an extremely capital-efficient way. This also allows us to be really nimble between different markets, depending on the macro environment, and be 100% Ready for the future electrification of air mobility, which we think will be coming soon with electric vertical aircraft that are gonna allow you to fly more quietly, which means communities are going to let you land more places, but are also going to let you do that in a more cost-effective manner. So we're focused on doing that and both passenger and medical where we're the largest transporter of human organs in the United States for transplant. But I'll start with your question. On passenger. Like I said, we're laser-focused on places where we can save folks a huge amount of time. And so for us today, that's in Canada, Western Canada, between Vancouver and Victoria, where we're taking what would be a three four-hour journey of car trips, Ferry rides, and we're turning that into a 30-35 minute helicopter flight between Vancouver and Victoria landing right in the middle of the city center for between $200 and $300. We're also in New York City where you already mentioned, we can take your two to three-hour trip between Manhattan and JFK make that a five-minute flight that starts at $195. If you're trying to get an Uber in New York, you know, it can often be more expensive than that. And then we're in southern France flying between Nice and Monaco, for about $200. That's a seven-minute flight. And also between Nice and Saint Tropez. And in the winter we fly between Geneva of course Courchevel and other ski destinations. These are the places in the world where for not a lot of money for something that costs very similar to what you might pay for ground transportation, we can save our customers a tremendous amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's awesome to hear. And it's very appealing to me. I live in Queens and yet JFK is also in Queens Yet somehow it still always takes me an hour just to get to JFK. So I'm sure there's more than a few of us listening to your last response. You say, Oh, my goodness, that sounds like a great alternative versus the MTA Blade does not only offer passenger transportation services well, but like you said, a growing medical transport segment. Let's talk the numbers though it reached $71.8 million in Q4 revenue growing 120%. Year over year. What is this segment entail? And why do you think you've been able to experience such high growth?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so just a quick clarification, the $71.8 million is the full-year revenue for 2022. But you're right. It's been growing triple digits year-over-year organically for the last several quarters, incredibly fast growth. And you know, the interesting thing about how we got started in medical, for better or for worse in New York City, we've always had 24/7 availability of crews, largely in case somebody wanted to go to Atlantic City in the middle of the night, which used to happen all the time. And we realized one day we've got all these aircrafts sitting around ready to go, incredibly affordable prices. Because we're flying them all the time to airports out to Long Island, we realized that we could actually help the hospitals here in New York, and we could provide them service to go pick up organs and get do it much more cost-effectively and much more quickly than any of the providers they've been using before. So we started just in our own home base here we're based in New York City, working with NYU Langone, we added Mount Sinai and we very quickly became the largest transporter of human organs here in the Northeast. And we realized it's the same aircraft for organ transportation. So quick primer on organ transportation. There's a group called UNOS here in the United States. This is the governing body that allocates organs to potential transplant recipients so that organization is going to say this donor could be a match with this recipient. And then they turn it over to the quarterback of any transplant mission, which is the transplant center or the hospital that is going to be putting that organ inside the recipient. So that is our customer. That is our credit. We don't have to deal with any insurance. We don't have to deal with reinsurance reimbursements. We're always getting paid from that hospital, that's our customer and they're generally two to three-year contracts. But where we really shine is all the same jets that we might be using for you to go between Palm Beach and New York City or the helicopters that we're using during the day to fly between JFK and Manhattan. Those same aircraft are what we utilize primarily at night to move organs for these hospitals. And you may or may not know, one of the biggest components of the cost of flying aircraft is the fixed costs, the salaries for the pilots, the liability insurance, and the lease payment you might pay as an operator to lease that aircraft from a lessor. Those are all costs that are borne by our network of third-party operators. But they also cost that if you fly more hours, you're now amortizing that fixed costs over more hours. So it actually costs you less to fly. So that's the magic of putting those two businesses together and Blade by having use cases during the day for our passengers. And use cases that are primarily at night for medical, we can offer the operators that fly on our behalf more hours, and we can eliminate some of their fixed costs, for example, they don't need customer service anymore, because we're doing all that mostly with our technology. And because they're flying that fixed costs over more hours, it costs everybody less to fly, they make more money, and we can pass through some savings to hospitals. And we have a very competitive product, we think the lowest-cost product in the United States to move organs for hospitals, and it allows them to go after more potential transplants. That's another really important point and our organ transportation business, because we're asset-light because we have aircraft distributed across the United States, ready 24/7. We can source an aircraft, that's not only the exact right size that a hospital needs at the exact right time, but increasingly at the exact right place. So it's a fragmented industry, most hospitals used to work with a mom-and-pop operator of a couple of aircraft that were based right near their hospital. The problem with that is that every trip needs to be a round trip. And a lot of times in organ transportation, you think you might pick up an organ and then pawn visual inspection, it's actually not going to be a match for the recipient. So if you're working with an operator that's based right near where you are, you're always going to have to pay for that full round-trip transportation, if you're working with Blade will have an aircraft on standby near the location where the donor is located, you can visually inspect that organ. And if it's not a match, you only pay a couple $1,000, you can imagine how overtime over a year, it costs the hospital so much less. And it also enables them to go after more organs. So you know, it's exciting that this is a great growing business. It's profitable for Blade on a segment-adjusted EBITA basis. But it's even more exciting for me and the team here that we have enabled hospitals to go after more organs than they otherwise might have been able to, because they have the confidence that not they're not going to be stuck with the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Will, I'd like to ask you a little bit about maybe some potential headwinds or challenges in this particular macroeconomic environment. Obviously, for all the talk about a recession, a lot of people are just sort of looking at the jobless claims and the numbers and the job cuts. And they're saying this a little bit more of a tech session or maybe a rich session. And given your kind of client base there. Are you seeing that kind of squeeze in terms of consumer spending among wealthier clientele, given some of the jobless numbers that we've seen across the country? And how, you know, some demographics of spenders may be hit more than others?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, well, look, we think we've built an incredibly resilient business on both sides of the house on the passenger and medical side. Obviously, on the medical side, it's hard to get more recession-proof than saving folk's lives by moving in organs, where you got one moment in time to get that to a recipient who needs it to save their life. But on the passenger side, we have extremely resilient customers, as we talked about even looking quarter to date as of our earnings call last week. For passenger, we're seeing a near doubling of our airport business in New York versus the prior year period, we had a record for airports here in New York, we've seen great results from being able to take price increases in some of our key markets, like New York to Long Island, where some routes we raise price up to 30%. We think we have great pricing power. We think we're targeting a unique group of people that's extremely resilient in any economic environment. And then the most important thing is right, we've got that asset light model. So if you look at our gross profit margin across the last several years, even through the pandemic, when of course, on the passenger side of the business, we saw a significant drop of volumes, what you saw is that our flight margins stayed very strong. That's because we don't have the fixed cost associated with flying that you would have if you owned a bunch of aircraft. So we're incredibly nimble. And if you ever did need to reallocate resources between medical and passenger or throttle capacity up or down, you'd be able to do that and still maintain really strong flight profit margins. Now, we haven't seen anything to suggest that there's any weakness in our flyer, but we're incredibly cool. afforded by the fact that we've got these two complementary business lines using the same aircraft assets to fly. And the asset-light model gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility. So I'm incredibly excited. I'm excited that we're still seeing growth, significant growth, particularly in markets like New York City. So so we're really feeling good at any macro environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin\u003c/strong\u003e: Absolutely. I do want to try and squeeze in these last two if I can first in the in the last quarter Blade completed its first test flights of an EVA, that's electrical vertical aircraft. You mentioned it a bit earlier with its partner Beta Technologies. Talk to us a bit more about EVA's and Blade's ambitions for this new aircraft, if you can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, we think this could be an incredible boost to the passenger and the medical business. On the medical side of the house. There are a lot of areas where you don't have access to rotorcraft, they're just too remote. And those machines are too expensive to be based on air all the time. And as a result, you might have a two-three hour drive to the nearest airport from a hospital where a donor is sitting, a heart only has four hours in transit. So it kind of takes them out of the running to get it anywhere except somewhere local. If you had a less expensive electric vertical aircraft or even a drone. Now you could go after organs that maybe you couldn't otherwise do on the passenger side of the business. Everything we're doing that 10-200 mile trip is specifically designed with electric vertical aircraft in mind. And the most important thing I can stress is that these aircrafts are quiet. The number one limiting factor in terms of creating new places that we can land is the noise that the community believes that helicopters could bring. By bringing an aircraft that's near silent and flight completely silent the moment after it shuts, it sits down because you can turn those rotors off immediately. Unlike a turbine holograph copter where they have to keep spinning, you can start adding new spokes onto our key hubs. So we have exclusive terminal infrastructure in places like New York, no one else has a heliport terminal at West 30 Street, East 34th street, you simply couldn't offer a service like ours in New York City, if you didn't have those exclusive terminals that we have. What we see from EVA is creating new places to fly to and from those key hubs that we had, if you had a heliport in Stamford, Connecticut, people could start commuting in, but it'd be very difficult to compete with us if you didn't have the infrastructure we have in New York City. So we're really employing a strategy of building those key hubs, those locations where urban air mobility can be profitable today with helicopters, building that moat in terms of customers that already fly the infrastructure that's exclusive to our technology that's specifically designed to operate this mission and a brand that's recognized around the whole world at this point so that when those electric vertical aircraft are ready for commercial use, we're already the market leader and we've got a huge head start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Finally, here Will, before I let you go, United Airlines previously invested $15 million into Air Mobility and also agreed to purchase 200 of its EVA's electrical air taxis. Talk to me about how Blade is viewing competition as an industry in terms of electrical air taxis and as the industry develops\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e As we've learned from our passenger and a medical business, you know, one size fits all does not apply to aviation, you need a different aircraft to fly an organ between New York and Boston than you might use to just fly that five minutes between JFK and Manhattan. So we're all about having a diversity of aircraft in our accessible fleet. And that's why we're staying in Switzerland and the electric vertical aircraft business, we're going to use the best aircraft for any given mission, our asset-light model allows us to pick the winners in terms of what aircraft is going to be most appropriate for each market, we're not putting a stake in the ground in terms of we have to use this aircraft here, this aircraft there. So we're very excited to work with all the electric vertical aircraft manufacturers, to the extent they create an aircraft that's going to work for our customers from a payload and cost perspective. So there's a lot still to learn about electric vertical aircraft. And Blade gives you the optionality, right? We've got customers, we've got them on roofs where we can make money, even with helicopters. And so if electric vertical aircraft are going to be slightly less expensive, which is what all the manufacturers today do, we can feel very confident that they should work well on the routes we're already operating. And we do not have our hands tied in terms of having to use one particular kind of aircraft because it's hard to know at this stage, who's going to be first to market and which aircraft is going to make the most economic sense. So we're trying to cast a wide net rather than pigeonhole ourselves with one particular manufacturer or one particular route, one particular place. So we think we're set up to be much more flexible than the competition and you know, at the end of the day, we have the customers and we have the passengers that are already flying. You can take a jog on the West Side Highway and you can see people getting into a Blade helicopter every 15-20 minutes. And we think that's going to make all the difference.

So I appreciate you taking the time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, thanks. Let's do it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSweet. So I want to get started here. Before we dive into the nitty gritty and the details of their earnings reports. Can you just explain to anybody who might not be familiar with MoneyLion what you do? Tell me about the company?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. At our core, we help connect customers with the right product, financial product, so whether that's a first party product or a third party product, you know, it's an authentic way for us to give our customers advice and content and at the same time, just making sure that you have all their financial needs met.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely, certainly makes a ton of sense. So let's get into the earnings report from earlier this week. So on the earnings call, you reiterated three key takeaways for investors. I would love it if you could recap what those three key takeaways were for our listeners today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so let me just, I want to read something from the Fun Police or lawyers, which is that as we're going through the financials or anything that I'm talking about, unless it's otherwise stated, I'll be referring to our non-GAAP adjusted results. And so you can see the appendix in our earnings release available on our IRS site for any of our GAAP results and reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure. And then, of course, you can always find our latest earnings presentations on moneyline.com.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo with your question, in terms of the three key takeaways that we highlighted on our earnings call, the first was that we reached a significant milestone, which is we reached positive adjusted EBITDA in the month of December. This also marked our fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA improvement. And so we're really proud of this milestone we've been working towards optimizing growth and profitability. And as everyone can appreciate a really dynamic market environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe others that we announced that we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2023. There aren't many of us in this kind of competitive space that can say that. And it's another great milestone for us as we turn the quarter corner towards delivering really kind of profitable growth at scale. And then we also surprise the analyst community by being months ahead of our EBITDA targets. So in terms of our Q4 results, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of expectations at the 6 million adjusted EBITDA or negative Don number was an improvement from 32 million a year prior and Q4 ‘21. And this was really driven by the performance in our consumer business, seeing the continued benefits of a lot of the operating leverage that our business was built to realize as well as around 15 million of annualized run rate, fixed cost savings that we actioned during the fourth quarter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second takeaway that was important for our investors is that we added over a million total customers in Q4. And we did that at a remarkably low CAC, which you've probably been following us is really kind of one of the things that differentiate us, and that's under a $10 CAC. And so we've been able to grow while actually reducing our marketing spend, and specifically reducing it with the paid digital channel. So you know, when you look at the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, those channels are becoming increasingly expensive. And so we benefit from having a unique way in terms of driving our top funnel. And we do that by having over 30 million inquiries a quarter. You know, that gives us a tremendous number of customers data and importantly intent that we can then optimize to, as I said at the beginning of this match customers with the right suite of products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe third key takeaway is that we reached quarterly adjusted to be EBITDA of 92 million in Q4 of ‘22, and this is up 70%, over the prior year quarter. And so for the full year of 2022, we had an adjusted revenue that increased nearly 100%, year over year to 328 million. And so because of this kind of diversified consumer and enterprise business model, we're able to continue delivering really strong performance across economic cycles. And so that's really the kind of key three takeaways that we wanted our investors to take away from the business update that we provided yesterday.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Yeah, I appreciate all that insight. And I think that we'll get more into this consumer and enterprise product lineup in just a couple of minutes here. But before we do get to that, with all of these key takeaways in mind, knowing that there are some pretty impressive stats and you know, some important numbers that you and your team shared earlier this week, I would love if you could just explain the context behind all of this, you know, not necessarily how you got there, but more so what does this mean? What do these big three key takeaways mean, for investors - for adding value for investors? Tell me a little bit about that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so when you look at why these matters, so much for us is one, it's unique for a company that has kind of both our growth trajectory and profitability trajectory, to meet the needs of our customers in such a meaningful way. And so whether our customers are experiencing, you know, times of need, or they have times of excess, we're able to deliver for them, either our first party or our third party products. And so when you think about the context of this, we exited the year, with 6.5 million total customers. And so our definition of customers are monetized customers, as opposed to just those that kind of browse our platform. And that's important, because it means that we're going to be delivering value to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second reason, when you look at the number of products that were taken by those customers, it's nearly 13 million. And so that's a really nice blend of both first party products that we provide, as well as third party products. And so it means they're actually meeting the needs of our consumers. And then we ended the year with over 1000 enterprise partners. And we'll touch upon this a bit more later, when you look at what we have, from an enterprise business perspective, we have one of the leading financial marketplaces out there. And so that means that we're helping our customers kind of get matched with product providers so that we're meeting their needs authentically. And then we amassed over 33 million unique customer profiles across our platform. And so what's really important about that is if you look at the recurring revenue profile of both of our consumer and enterprise businesses, it means that our customers are coming back to us, because we're actually helping them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo on the consumer side, for example, over 75% of our revenue comes from our historical cohorts, whether it's kind of pre 2019, or 2020, or 2021, and even 2022. Every day that we wake up, over 75% of our revenue are coming from customers that we acquired historically. And then on the enterprise side, we have a similar type of profile, we have over 80% of our enterprise customers that represent revenue – recurring revenue that we are realizing. And so what does that mean, again, we wake up every day, and we are generally generating over 80% of our revenue in the enterprise side from historical cohorts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen just digging down into the customers. You know, the thing that we have been proud about doing within MoneyLion is having some of the leading unit economics. So we've kind of talked about the customers that we added in the fourth quarter, we added just over a million of them. And we did that, as I mentioned earlier at about an $8 CAC. And so if you went back a year that you know, our CAC was in the 20s, and every quarter, we've been able to improve our CAC and kind of keep it at that low level, because of the unique type of funnel that we have. That then translates into a two month payback period. And importantly, we're able to do that at a really strong ARPU, and so our ARPU was at over $60. And again, while we're spending less than $10, to acquire them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat. So you know, with all these numbers in mind, and noting, especially to your final point, you just made here the trend that these numbers seem to be following and these metrics seem to be following, they appear to be pretty significant for the money line and for the future of your business. And I'm curious about the general circumstances in which these numbers were tallied, you know, you think about the macro climate, the economic circumstances that any business would be facing in most of last year, certainly at the end of last year. I'm curious about how those macro circumstances impacted the financials that you reported and also, you know, how they might impact the way that you go about the future quarters. You know, once we get past the quarters that you were, of course reporting on earlier this week. Tell me a little bit about your perspective and your take on everything that's happening in the macro sense and how it impacts your business?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that is a great question. You know, one of the things that's unique about where we are positioned is we have a really interesting window into the American consumer. We also have an interesting window into a lot of the market participants on the enterprise side, right? The kind of big channels where customers are looking for products, as well as those big companies that are delivering those financial products. And so with those windows, where we kind of have a good sense of how the consumer is performing and behaving. And I think what we see right now is they're, they're pretty resilient still. And we're uniquely positioned because of this mix between our consumer and enterprise business. So on the consumer side, we're continuing to see consumers having a lot of demand for financial products and demand for credit. And demand for the kind of higher yield savings that they're seeing, you know, are very different than the type of yield that they receive in their deposit accounts, one, two, three years ago.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then on the enterprise side, you know, channel partners are still seeing a lot of consumers spending time looking for ways to kind of improve their financial lives. We have seen, you know, some headwinds, from the kind of product providers where just kind of given the raising rate environment, you know, they're having to step back or tighten their risk box, which means it just isn't as much available, as we kind of saw in late Q3 and certainly part of Q4 of ‘22 customers having access to that. And so I think what's been important is having, for us, both a consumer business and an enterprise business allows us to be able to continue to hit our financial targets, because they kind of work as almost a hedge where what we've seen with the consumer side is we're able to kind of drive more and more kind of transaction fees, those type of direct deposit interchange revenue lines, as we kind of saw some headwinds, as I said, with the enterprise side of the business. With that position, just really to your question about what it means for the future, it means that we'll be able to continue to execute and realize the momentum that we've been having. If you look at the overall mix of our business, from an enterprise and consumer perspective, you know, consumer is about 65% of the revenue mix in enterprise is about 35%. And that's a slight shift more towards consumer relative to what we were expecting, you know, six months ago, we thought we'd start trending more and more towards 50-50. But again, that's a benefit for us, as we start to see that the shift or the tailwinds that we see in the consumer side, tend to offset some of the headwinds that we see on the enterprise side.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotally and noting, to your point that this could, in some ways, behave as a hedge that you have these two forks in the business. I'm curious about how, you know, it might be what the experience might be building both a consumer and an enterprise part of the business, in what could be construed as, as volatile economic circumstances or a volatile economic environment? Is that a difficulty for MoneyLion? And if so, tell me about how you try to, you know, establish these two business entities or, you know, I don't want to suggest that they're separate entities, but two parts of your business that serve a different customer? Is it difficult to develop both of those and to mature both of those at the same time, knowing that the economic climate is not the most hospitable?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, another great question, which so, I think fortunately, for us, it's all built. You know, certainly there are always optimizations and improvements that you're doing. But we are, you know, easily the most full featured offering out there from a financial bank perspective that exists. So for some companies that might have a feature as an entire company, we have that embedded, it's just a feature. So for example, like a round ups. And so if you kind of looked at the MoneyLion app, from a consumer perspective, it's fully built, it's the most full featured product that exists out there, we encourage people to download the app and play around with it, it's free, you get access to incredible kinds of content. And then the more that you interact with it, the more personalized it becomes, and the more that we're able to help people\u0026nbsp; access the right mix of financial products. And so, you know, from an enterprise perspective, you know, there are always ways to continue to improve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo to give people a little more transparency into what that means from an enterprise perspective, we are a network and we're a technology company. What we help our channel partners do is we allowed them to be able to have a very flexible, different ways in which they can basically use our technology, you can kind of have an embedded piece of software, we can host an entire white label type of site for you, you can kind of have a mobile version of it. And that allows our channel partners to kind of optimize the way in which they want to have customer experience to meet their needs. And however, basically, those channel partners are kind of routing customers to us, or people that have high intent to us, on the other side of the equation, are our very fast set of product partners. And again, we have deep integration, and we give them software that allows them to kind of tweak the way in which they want to see customers, the type of customers, they want to see the frequency to help them meet their needs. And so for that perspective, again, that's already all built. Of course, we're always looking at ways to optimize the funnel, we're always looking at ways to add more and more new types of enterprise web services that we can deliver to those partners.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut you know, when we look at the macro environment ahead, and it's incredibly difficult to kind of look forward and think about what that macro can unveil for our business. But we're confident because whichever way the market kind of tilts over the next coming quarters, we're going to either kind of realize our plan, or we're going to be able to take advantage of credit partners and the credit boxes, the risk boxes that will widen back up. And that allows us to kind of further you know, meet that on that demand that we're seeing. It's increasing quarter over quarter from the client side with products that meet their needs. So we think that at a minimum for us, we execute against our plan, we get to EBITDA positive over the year, and with some tailwinds, and with some kind of macro positive news, you know, the kind of back after the year we get to kind of spring load into outperformance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, makes a ton of sense. And I think this answer specifically speaks to some of MoneyLion’s potential competitive advantages moving into the future. So with that in mind, I would love to just hear your perspective broadly about the future of the FinTech space, what is exciting to you right now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think what's exciting, and we're excited because we kind of play a really unique position within the FinTech space, which is I think, some people try to kind of pigeonhole us into being, you know, a neobank, or patroness into being, you know, a lender or petitioners into being kind of a robo-advisor. We are all of the above. But importantly, we're really just that interface layer to the customer. And so what we are able to do is really kind of play that kind of Swiss role, where we are a data company and a technology company that is able to take our customer and give them access to the right product. And that can be a product from any FinTech provider. So what's exciting about us as there is, more and more FinTech players are entering the space, they're always kind of driving innovation. And we get to take advantage of that by making those products available to our customers, whether it's an insurance, whether it's in mortgages, whether it's an auto refi, even when you start to look at some of the things that are kind of very budget intensive, so travel, spend on a car, things like that, we're even able to give our customers access to those types of, of non financial products through our partners, through our overall Money Lions membership or while membership. So it's a really exciting place to be in a space to be because we hope there are more and more market entrants into the FinTech space, and specifically on the product side so that we can make that available to our customer base.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and we're certainly excited to watch how FinTech unfolds in the coming months and years. Certainly, it's been a very interesting past couple of weeks. I shouldn't even be that generous – the past couple of days following the FinTech space. So we are going to have to check back, Rick, and see how things pan out for the next couple of months and years. So with that, I want to thank our wonderful guests today, Rick Correia, CFO at MoneyLion for his time. Rick, thank you so much.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. I look forward to being back next quarter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course. And thank you again to our partners at MoneyLion who made today's show possible. We will be back next month with even more news and updates from the FinTech economy. Thank you so much for listening, and I'll see you next time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["EXEC_Q_A"],"sponsorDetailsDto":{"sponsor":{"id":"4AZld8DNW0SHRqXId0wbVmvxC5OfvNaE","name":"MoneyLion","disclosure":"","imageUrl":""},"symbols":["ML"]},"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"902e27b4-f7a8-41d1-b4b6-d03c446c5ffa","username":"kinsey","displayName":"Kinsey Grant","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/Sosi4hWQpiDT3ZXndA3KXkEbz0Mpi2fi-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"host of Thinking Is Cool","followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"7236716d-cac0-42e1-b575-98ae067aa0eb","username":"rickcorreia","displayName":"Rick Correia","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/nO9LTaZAkkxhrXlF4tkJcbJlGrUbU3E6-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"CFO at MoneyLion","followedByMe":false,"following":false}],"stocks":[{"symbol":"ML","name":"MoneyLion"}],"slug":"https://app.public.com/live/stock-market/interview-with-moneylions-cfo","uniqueId":"m2kA8FGqPRsJAnX6dr9Zsm7gV9TLMXOP","status":"PUBLISHED","linkedIds":["nw96ZGLbPoxnVotZydc80nXCMYoY9GUn","XZ6CgnSgEC1SWKGctrmeZ9353WDgj1SL"],"cta":{"buttonText":"Sign up","title":"Interview with MoneyLion's CFO","subtitle":"Invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptos, alts, and more.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Hello, everyone, and good afternoon and welcome to Public Live this Thursday, March 9th. I am your host, Kori Hale and today folks, we're going to be discussing Spotify’s recent Stream On event and be updating you on Metas year of efficiency as well as other big tech news. And I'm excited because this is one of my favorite guests we have on the show with us today. It's Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. Mark is also if that wasn't enough, and it is but he is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 times stock picking lessons for one of Wall Street's top tech analysts. And of course, right here on Public, we're doing book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public alive handle. Alright, Mark, welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e It's good to be back, Kori.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e We're always happy to have you join us. And of course, you break down as some of these big tech names on Wall Street, as I mentioned, and we got to talk about Spotify. The streaming platform recently hosted its Stream On event and announced many new features planned for the app. For those of us who maybe did not catch that announcement, could you provide some insight into some of the standout features that were discussed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMark Mahaney: Okay, I think this was their fifth annual Stream On event. It's kind of their product. It's like their customer event, but it's really kind of a product development event. I guess that's what it is. It's it's like, it's like Apple's worldwide developer conference. Now not nearly as impactful or meaningful as that, but it's just this is where they roll out their latest innovations. So there was some new disclosure to the founder, Daniel Eck, the CEO announced that they are now over half a billion monthly visitors, which means that monthly average users, which means that they're now a little bit ahead of their guidance for the March quarter, it's a small thing for the financial folks out there. Second is they disclose that Spotify recommendations are powering more than half of users streams. And why that matters is you know, the more that Spotify is music, people who listen to Spotify, listen to curated music, rather than just going on there and saying, you know, I want this song by Taylor Swift, the extent to which they kind of give the wheel, give the mic, give the turntable that's the right one, Kori, give the turntable to Spotify and say, play me something interesting. That means that Spotify becomes more influential, and that means that artists then want to pay to kind of influence To that influence, or that they're willing to advertise, you know that that creates more of an opportunity for them, you know, the, the retailer who simply just fulfills, doesn't generate margins as nice as the retailer who actually suggests and can and can influence tastes and patterns and things like that. And then the last thing that I thought was interesting is they have a new home feed that's coming out. And I think it's a little bit what I would call the TikTok isation of Spotify. So you're gonna see more TikTok-like features short-form video kind of right up front, you can see sort of a little bit of endless feed is the wrong word, but you're gonna see some of that you're gonna see more than just the static feed when you start. So these are all going to all these little nuances that sort of improve, they also talked about an AI DJ, I'm not sure we're going to really notice a difference, but we'll try it out. And then a new ad format, that's kind of a small video ad format, anything that generates ad revenue for Spotify is going to be good for their gross margins. So those are the features that came out of Spotify’s Stream On on event yesterday,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark, I love that you brought up actually a plethora things that I want to really quickly piggyback off of. And also, we probably have lots of Swifties in our audience, and they probably were like, Mark, we only play Taylor Swift straight through. We don't need any sort of DJ for that. But the interesting thing about what I are what came to my mind was Payola back in the day, which I might be dating myself back in the radio days, when radio was a massive thing, right in artists, more so record labels are paying radio DJs right to play their particular artists. Are you saying then since there's more of this suggesting type of thing that's going to happen with Spotify going forward that there could be some streaming Payola-ish version at some point?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, you're using a very loaded word and Payola and you know, in some senses, that's what it is. But in some senses, maybe we need to rethink it a little bit. So when you use Google search engine, do you think about all those paid ads within Google as Payola? In other words, you know, when when you do a search for, you know, tickets to March Madness games, basketball games, or when you do a search for, you know, Hawaiian, you know, budget, airfare, and you get these paid results in there. I mean, that's essentially I've thought about this as Google's I'm sorry, as Spotify, Googling it search results, you go on there, and you look at today's top country hits, or today's you know, whatever hit it, and hip hop, I think they've got it, they've got something, you know, for a Christian country, I mean, they've got every possible genre you can imagine in there. And if you're an emerging artist, and if you're in a label, you know, this is like, this is a target-rich environment. I mean, these are people listening to your genre, you're a new artist, you know, like to you to here's an opportunity for you to advertise your song so that Italy shows up somewhere in the queue. Now, many people may not listen to your music, but at least here's a chance to market or advertise. And so that's kind of how we think about it. And so I don't know if that answers your question. But that's what that's the exact intent behind Spotify. And what they've done is given labels the ability to market to advertise their newest labels, their newest features, their newest artists, one of the world's largest, most influential music platforms, if you can make it on Spotify, you can make it anywhere. Spotify makes or breaks artists. And then sorry, but that is true, given how they've got half a billion people who listen to the surface, and probably 250 million who listen to it on a daily basis. There's no music listening service outside of YouTube, that's any bigger any more influential than that. And so that's how I think about and I've always thought about it as a great opportunity last year, I think they generate about $200 million in revenue a little bit more than that, from this what is what I call this advertising revenue. I think it's good for Spotify’s business model. And I also do think it creates opportunities for us of the artists that are on Spotify, here's a chance for them to here's a chance for them to promote their work their blood, sweat and toil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, you know what, Mark that makes me think what else do you think is good for Spotify his business model because right now you're holding a price target of $185 on their stock with an outperform rating. What is it beyond that? The fact that they're getting this half a billion monthly active users that really, you know, has you all over at Evercore ISI so pro Spotify?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I am pro Spotify. I was pro-Spotify last year Kori I think you remember that. And the stock tanked. I thought we were going to have an inflection point last year we didn't. And I thought I meant that in terms of gross margins. This is why I like Spotify here and I may be wrong again. You know, but I'm trying to get it right this time. So one, we know that the multiple has come down dramatically on this one This thing goat used to go at four or five, six times, he'd be, you know, enterprise value to sales. Now we're sub two times like that's cheaper than Netflix is cheaper than, well, sort of online dating companies which are somewhat similar. I mean, this is a subscription business and an advertising business, although it's mostly a subscription business. So I think it's cheap. I think the estimates have been de-risk. I think the multiple has then been de-risked. They've started taking some cost actions, they probably overbuilt like a lot of tech companies. So they've been taking some cost actions. But why I particularly like the setup this year, is that I think you're finally at a place where you're going to cut back on some of that podcast investment, heavy spending that they've had. So I think you're finally going to get gross margins to move up. For low gross margin businesses. When you see gross margins move up, it's almost always a major catalyst for the stock. Second is they are likely to implement a price increase their biggest competitors, Apple and Amazon have both implemented a price increase. So it gives it kind of raises the umbrella a little bit and allows them to raise prices. Usually, that's a good thing for companies and for and for stocks. And then the third thing is Kori, last year, they had a record number of new users globally they added the number was something like 70 million. And what typically happens with Spotify is people come on as free users. And then over time, they kind of migrate a decent number of migrate over to be paid subscribers. So if the pick of the record MAU growth last year converts into paid subscriber growth, boom, I got my third catalyst for this year. So that's why I like it. I think the thing can recover to sort of like two times EV to sales. I just don't think that's an aggressive multiple. I know we're in a tough market for for growth equities. This year. This is a company that's been consistently free cash flow positive, admittedly a very small, minimal level, but I do like it and I think it's it's the leading way to play music streaming worldwide. So that's why we that's why we're pitching Spotify is one of our top longs this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e See Mark just because you were wrong last year, that doesn't mean you're wrong. This year. We're not even before three months into the year and Spotify obviously doing pretty well. However, competition this year for Spotify, right also completely ticking up. This is no pun intended specifically with TikTok, right. This is a major competitive threat. Spotify has, you know, acknowledged this, you know, as part of their business model the company is working to obviously expand its streaming globally. TikTok has already said that, do you actually see Tik Tok as a threat to Spotify? Especially with maybe the legal issues by legal I mean regulatory issues around TikTok in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori I may be wrong, but I don't think so. I think the bigger competitive risk really is Apple Music. YouTube music, Amazon music. Those are kind of the more direct So, let's see. Yeah, I think I'm not sure the competition is greater. But yes, TikTok has got a, you know, huge audience worldwide. It's one of those things where can the brand really be stretched? Are people going to really think about like, TikTok is a wonderful experience for you know, for consumers. It's just highly entertaining, addictive, maybe, but also truly highly entertaining. But it's a different type of entertainment than music. And I'm in one of the problems that TikTok is apparently having is getting the rights that Spotify spent a lot of time getting from the labels. So I just, I'm not at all sure that TikTok is going to come out and directly compete with, with Spotify. I'll take the other side on that I may be wrong. I worry about the other companies. But I've just noticed in the seven years I've been running surveys on Spotify, every year, they seem to gain more share of ear can I say that, share of ear you know, like their their share of people listening to streaming music on Android devices. And by the way on Apple devices has pretty consistently risen over the last couple of years. So they're doing something right the real issue on the stock and why it hasn't done anything since its IPO is or direct listing is the business model and people want to see the gross margins go up people want to see them start generating substantial amounts of free cash flow they generate minimal amount but let's get chunky. Let's get a lot of free cash flow. I think they can start gapping up that gross margin this year start growing it I think 10 People can start believing again that there can be sizable free cash flow and that could cause the rewriting in the stock to go up this year. That's why I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e All right. No, I I'm with you on that Mark. I want to shift really quickly while we have some time though and cover another big tech company which is Facebook's parent company Meta they're entering into their year of efficiency are since entering I guess it's continuing as the social media giant is expected to layoff thousands more or employees as early as this week. Might I also add it is not lost on me that a company that's shifting into a year of efficiency, which is away from the metaverse after they changed the parent company name to Meta is a lot of questions in my mind around that. However, this is the second largest scale cut these layoffs by Meta. How many more can investors expect as part of this year of efficiency?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I do think it's necessary the year of efficiency. You know, we there's two factors that are going on here. One is that overall demand trends are softening for macro economic reasons. And so layoffs aren't fun. I've gone through them, you know that they're painful for everybody involved, especially if you're one of those people getting laid off. But you know, when times get tough, we all the households tighten their belts and companies need to tighten their belts. And one way you do that, is you unfortunately have to let go some of your employees. The other thing, though, that's one factor. But the other one that Jim maybe just as material and maybe more so is that there clearly are some companies that overbuilt post the COVID crisis, I think Amazon was one I think, Meta was one if you were to go back and look at the revenue growth between 2019 and 2022. And then the OPEX growth, your operating expense growth, you'll see there's a couple of companies that really stick out that they grew their expenses more than their revenue, even though revenue shot up materially between 2019 and 2022, the expenses grew even more. And I think these companies sort of assumed that there was this positive inflection and demand for the services that we kind of continue on for many, many years. That didn't happen. It's not like we've gained, it's not like we've reverted to 2019. It's just that the growth rates have kind of more normalized, rather than just kind of kept it accelerating level. Anyway, all of that is Meta was one of those companies, demand trends are softening for online advertising, no question about it as they are for all marketing spend, and this company over hired, and it's probably the right thing for them to do to take these layoffs. I you know, I think what's been reported recently, I think that is probably going to happen. There's enough there's enough smoke there. There's got to be some hiring fire. I think that's good. I think that actually was a surprisingly good pun. And then I'm going to use that in the note thank you, Kori. And then, but yeah, so I think that's happened. And I think it helps, what investors want to see is defend the bottom line, you know, you can't control what's going to happen to you know, ad marketers, and how much they're going to spend in a recession, you can control your cost basis, and show me that you're going to do that show me your grown-up company. And Zuckerberg kind of weaved and waved a little bit last year. But I think he got to the I think he finally I think most of the signals he gave were it Yes, I'm a mature company, CEO. I'm a CEO, I'm a mature CEO of a company, it may be a mature company. And we need to be much more careful about expenses. And it's not growth at all costs. And when he started to do that, I think he's been rewarded by the market. And I think there's more of that coming. And I also think that the revenue growth trends are going to improve at Facebook because I think they're improving their ad tracking their ad attribution models. And I think they're going to be able to better monetize reels, which I think has turned out to be phenomenally successful for both Instagram and Facebook in terms of new users and more engagement. So I really like Meta here. I think it's still cheap at 14 times earnings. And I think there's 50% upside in the stock. So it's actually my number one pick right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow, number one pick. I didn't know that's where you were going with that mark. But that's that's a strong conviction there. Okay. Number one pick, you know what I was thinking to in the broader tech scheme, something I'd love to get your insights on. We don't have time to do it today. So we'll have to have another session. But I really want to pick your brain around chat GPT around Microsoft's login strategy, how you see that playing into revenue. What does that do to Google? Especially because you brought up ads of the like and how that all could really up in certain business revenue lines across different tech companies. I don't know if you've given that any thought but I'd love to hear what you have to say on that next time around. Next time around. All right, everyone. This was a great session. By the way I love this and I we always love when Mark comes on and shares his insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the interset internet research team over at Evercore ISI don't forget about the book giveaway that we're doing DM us and Public Live handle today. You can get Mark’s latest book, which is nothing but net can timeless stock-picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts.

I'm your host Connor Round and I'm so happy to be here with you today to discuss the key themes in AI and the industries that it can bring innovation and growth to. I'm thrilled to welcome my guest today, Ivana Delevska, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Spear Invest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks for having me, Connor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to start off, you know, we're here to talk about artificial intelligence. It's an opportunity that has use cases beyond the human imagination. So just to start off when considering business applications of AI, could you help investors understand what industries and sectors you see greatly benefit from the innovations in the space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sounds great. Connor so many people under appreciate the fact that AI today is already a $100 billion industry and it's still in the very early innings. The main applications that we see it used in today would be for consumer technologies. So it would be for like recommenders in cases like TikTok or e-commerce where you're getting recommended products to buy. So that's one of the largest applications that we see today. But looking forward, we think AI will be transformational for many industries, traditionally industrials, automotive, life sciences. We think it's really going to have a transformative impact for the broader industrial complex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVery interesting. And could you just break down the AI capabilities that you see within the social media space?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, yeah, so it's interesting social media. Previously, all of the innovation or all of the use cases in AI were based on this recommender model. So basically, companies like TikTok would in-house train their their models to be able to tell based on few data points on videos that you watch, they're going to be able to form a whole profile about you, and then be able to, to recommend you other videos, and they can be really addictive as most people, most people have seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's kind of the main use case today. Now, the new thing in AI is this transformer model, which was the concept or the paper was written and introduced in 2016. But you've really seen these models just getting trained, these large language models. So Chat GPT, is one application of this large language model, it's based on a model called GPT 3 that was introduced in 2021. So a lot of people are excited about the applications of Chat GPT today, but I will highlight that this is just one kind of flavor of the opportunity that we see going forward.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, I'm actually happy you brought up chat GPT that was just gonna go right into that. Apart from it kind of just expanding and, you know, breaking out into the scene very quickly. How do you see other companies reacting in the space? Do you see Google coming out with a new search engine capability? I'd love to hear your opinion on that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so we see Microsoft and Google, as potentially being leaders on the language side, Microsoft has maybe a head start, they've invested quite a bit here. And we've seen quite a lot from them. They're behind the GPT 3 language model, but they also recently announced an even newer model with even more parameters, 530 billion parameters, so we're gonna see a lot more from them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGoogle has been pretty quiet. They were maybe the leader several years ago. So we are waiting to hear what's going to come out of them. Investors believe that they have something, but it's kind of TBD. So as of right now, those are the two that are going to be leaders in the lead on the language model side. But it's very important for investors to realize that when you invest, you don't necessarily just want the direct beneficiary over trend, there is going to be a lot of investment in the infrastructure beyond behind like, behind AI. So for Microsoft, it's not just on the Bing side that they can introduce Chat GPT and kind of help jumpstart their business, but they're really going to benefit on the cloud side as well. So from an investment perspective, right now, we're finding better risk rewards in investing in the infrastructure. So it would be semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity as well. So yeah, so basically, the point here is beware of value traps, right? You don't want to invest in something that will get competed away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. And just to keep on Chat GPT, a lot of the hype has brought excitement to firms. And it kind of seems to be a similar trend to that of the crypto boom in 2021, with BuzzFeed announcing Chat GPT similar implications. Just wanted to know, do you see this as maybe a trend that will die down? Or is this something that we can expect to last?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell ChatGPT specifically, what you will need to see is people building things that are going to be useful on it. So specifically, for us, we're looking for maybe broader opportunities than that. But AI is a trend that is definitely not going to die down. As I mentioned before, it's already a $100 billion dollar industry. So whether Chat GPT takes off or not, it’s not really going to have..it will have some implications on AI but it's not really going to have broad implications for AI, if that makes sense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDefinitely and as you said, it is a $100 billion industry already. But in order to rev up innovation in this space further, much hardware and infrastructure will be required, such as the need for, you know, the much reliance semiconductor industry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat types of semiconductors, so we could just help investors understand, are required for building out AI, and how much of the industry is dedicated to its face?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, so, so thanks for asking that question, Connor. So basically, in order to train these models, you need GPUs. And that's why companies like Nvidia produce these today. And basically GPUs allow computers to do parallel operations and the reason why people are all of a sudden so excited about AI versus say a year or two ago is that prior to the transformer model, and prior to this language, first language models, trained AI will just be able to do prescriptive tasks. So, if you give it a bunch of images, it can learn what you're showing it, right? So it wouldn't necessarily be able to put things into context or draw its own conclusions. So in order to be able to put things into context and draw its own conclusions, the model sizes have increased exponentially. So maybe five years ago, in 2018, the model sizes would have been less than 100 million parameters. Today, these models that are trained and deployed are over over 500 billion parameters. So the amount of GPUs that are required for this is exponential.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, and what players in the space do you see benefiting from increased demand for AI related chips such as GPUs?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e So in video is gonna be a big beneficiary full disclosure, we all not only video stock, and we disclose all of our holdings on our website, but then you may be able to see the reason why Nvidia is such a beneficiary is because they came up with this CUDA architecture that is free for people to use. So if you want to build something on AI, all you need to do is buy the NVIDIA hardware, and then you can use these frameworks for free. Other companies are not there yet. So you could still buy GPUs from AMD. But then what do you do with them? But over time, as the industry develops, there is likely going to be other solutions, and maybe some of these other companies that are developing GPUs will benefit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area we really like that is not doing very well right now, is cloud infrastructure. So a lot of the cloud names are getting hit pretty hard, because of enterprise spending cuts. So this is a sector that hasn't really done that well in this recent bounce, this year. Nvidia is already up quite a bit here today, but the cloud cloud names have really not performed in line, so we like that. And then as you deploy AI, you're going to have a lot more vulnerabilities so you're going to need newer cybersecurity solutions. So this is another area where we find a lot of opportunities – basically how do you secure? How do you secure these AI workloads? And how do you secure eight edge computing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, so a lot of industries that are going to see some upside there and those segments, but the industry has struggled with keeping up with shift demand through supply chain constraints, severely dealing with shortages throughout the years of 2021 and 2022. If AI demand gears up in the near future, will semiconductor firms be able to manage their supply chains to keep up with demand trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we see a lot of supply actually getting added over the next two to three years. So we think there is going to be plenty of supply of chips available. And just to explain how this works, basically companies like Nvidia and AMD, they don't manufacture the chips, but they just design them and then foundries like TSMC will do the actual manufacturing. So we're seeing - this is a pretty big trend actually that's supporting even broader economic activity in the U.S. are these large CapEx investments by the foundries or the large chip manufacturers like TSMC. Intel as well has expansion plans. So there's going to be plenty of supply, we believe to meet the demand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat And just lastly, could you just break down the traditional segments of the semiconductor space? What spaces or segments do you see slowing down? And are there any other ones that you see an opportunity, and I know that you named a few, but if you just break them down for investors to understand a little bit more, I think that'd be fantastic. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. So basically the big separation is between consumer and data center. So, if you look at, for example, TSMC, revenues would be like half consumer, like a very high level, half consumer half data center. So consumer would be used in PCs, smartphones, and then on the data center side, this would be like cloud, cloud vendors, and in any sort of enterprise computing. And then within the data center segment, we're seeing slowdown across the board. So the consumer got pretty hard hit at the beginning of last year, PC demand has been significantly down but the way semis work is usually there is a lot of inventory in the system. So what the manufacturers or designers see is a lot worse than what in demand looks like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as inventory stabilizes, TSMC said that they're expecting it to stabilize at the beginning of this year, and to see pick up in the second half of next year. And then similarly, on the data center side, that segment just started seeing some weakness, but we believe that the high performance computing, which is what we talked about with Nvidia, like the chips that are required for AI, we expect those will hold up better.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat.

I'm your host Ann Berry and we are always diving in together to the latest from the world of investing. Today, we are focused on energy transformation and what it means to be an investor in this space. Joining me as our guest today is Yasmine Dayha Bilger who is the head of ETFs at Engine No. 1. Yasmine, welcome to Public Llive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks so much for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would love to jump right in Yasmine and learn more about what Engine No. 1 is focused on besides sounding like a fire station. But perhaps appropriate given the topic? Could you just walk our audience through what you do, who you all are and what it is that you guys are focused on?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely. And in fact, you are right on the fire station piece. So\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003epretty good image. But absolutely. So number one is an investment firm that is focused on identifying and investing around what we believe are large scale transformational investment themes. We're a firm founded by former hedge fund and private market investors and have a background in deep fundamental analysis. We launched a little over two years ago, and I think are probably best known for our activist campaign in which we successfully placed three people on the board of directors at ExxonMobil.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think, actually, the campaign was quite interesting, because it reflects, I think, two things that really sit across the entire firm, really pillars of what we do. The first is that we were able to do that while only owning five basis points of the company. Well, the reason we were able to was because we focused all of our arguments and recommendations on why they were additive to long term shareholder value, which allowed I think other investors to vote alongside of us. And I think what it shows is, if you've grabbed your thinking in economics, you can accomplish quite a lot in the public markets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second that I think is kind of reflective of what we do is that we're an engagement focused company. And usually in the space of climate, the mantra is, if you don't like it, you don't own it. So most climate strategies don't own the largest emitting sectors, the largest emitting companies – we very much own and deeply engage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so just to sort of unpack that a little bit more, first of all, as an activist with less than five basis points of ownership to to effect that change, Yasmin, it really brings to life what you say by actively engaging.\u003c/span\u003eLet's talk a little bit more into the work that Engine No. 1 is doing specifically on the topic of energy transformation. It's a really buzzy topic, everyone's talking about it. I'm just back from Davos, Yasmin, where climate and energy transformation was just a huge focus area. Help us cut through the jargon. What does energy transformation really mean, in your context?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, absolutely. So there are a number of reasons why we see a significant move towards decarbonization across our energy systems. Now, with that said, I think it's really important to note that we, as many other people believe that we continue to have a real near term need for fossil fuels. So that's really the transformation we're talking about. It's not a light switch. And I'd also say a lot of people talk about this as the energy transition. And there's so many terms that goes around. To us, that sort of implies a one to one move from traditional fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. But this is much more about truly a transformation of our entire energy system, and will take decades to play out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you did mention it's an enormous investment opportunity. By some estimates, it will require somewhere between $3-5 trillion of investment per year to meet Net Zero targets. So the opportunity creates a lot of investment opportunities, in fact, and they're not just in one sector, when people traditionally think about the energy sector. They really do span our entire economy. I will say I think the opportunity in my opinion is a little misunderstood. I think as I mentioned, the traditional thinking and climate is if you don't like it, you don't own it. So what does that really mean?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMost people tackling climate from an investment perspective, almost definitively have no exposure to traditional oil and gas companies, for example, are basically not exposed at all to the largest sources and uses of energy. We flip the entire conversation of this theme on its head. But just as a set stat to give this to life to people, nearly 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions just come from three segments of our economy, energy, agriculture and transportation, that is the heart of the energy transition. And in our opinion, to drive that sort of decarbonisation at scale, you really need to go where the emissions are. And I think it's the transformation of these various systems that we'll see both, you know, a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions, but also huge investment opportunities for people looking to take advantage of some of the dollars that are being put to work in these spaces.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to really drill into that, Yasmine, to make sure that there's no ambiguity here. So the ETF that you have, together at Engine No. 1 one does or does not include the stocks of what we people might think of as the more traditional carbon focused energy production companies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, we absolutely do our energy\u0026nbsp; transition focus strategy. Net Z absolutely has exposure to the companies that we believe are leading and benefiting from the transformation, which include companies exactly in those segments. I mean, if you think about it, if three-quarters of emissions are coming from the systems themselves, the leaders and incumbents as well as the enablers within these systems will be the companies that actually should benefit most from it. And so we do actually own traditional oil and gas companies, we own auto companies, we own agriculture companies. Now with all that said, these are the companies that are making the investments and have the I'd call it a short, medium and long term strategies to think about how they win in a world with lower carbon emissions. So they're absolutely focusing on the theme. But I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about where the opportunity lies from a company perspective.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat's a really interesting clarifying point, Yasmine, because I do think that there is this bias or this general perception that when you see instruments out there focused on energy transformation, they tend to exclude some of those traditional players. And just, you know, as an observation that we've seen, you know, in our discussions on public life, a lot of these energy, traditional energy stocks have done quite well, performance wise recently. So it's so interesting that you guys are not shying away from those rather, instead, including those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou've been very enthusiastic and emphatic about the fact that energy transformation, as you've defined it, is positioned to be an impactful opportunity and it's going to touch a myriad of industries. You talked about the three largest, can you just unpack for us a little bit more? It was transportation, agriculture, and energy as the biggest pockets of opportunity. But within that, where are you seeing key trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely. So maybe I'll say two things up front. In order to best take advantage of this opportunity, I have two beliefs. One, I think this is absolutely the space for active investment. I think you need to manage your hunting for the best opportunities across this value chain. Secondly, I think you need to be thinking broadly about the opportunity beyond just one sector, you need to be looking at the largest producers and consumers of energy and thinking about how these systems evolve. So maybe two examples to bring that to life. Transportation is a huge source of emissions. Now, most investors when they think about the opportunity and transfer, transportation are really thinking about the move to electric vehicles, and are solely focused on the automakers as they make a push to electrify their car fleet. Now, that is absolutely part of the opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, the real broader investment opportunity is much, much wider than that. You also need to think about the elements that are required to accomplish that electrification. So with that broader view, you would be looking at spaces like the metals and inputs that are required to produce batteries such as Lithium, for example. You would be thinking about the companies that are required to extract those metal metals, like mining equipment companies. You would also be thinking about the transportation of those inputs to battery plants, so you know what companies would benefit from this change in transportation. And I think the broader framing is much wider in that we play across that ecosystem and are sort of looking on a short, medium and long term basis for where we think the best opportunities lie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area maybe to highlight would be in agriculture. I think one of the interesting areas within agriculture is just precision agriculture. This is really about giving technology to farmers to be more precise and efficient in their usage of fertilizer and other chemical inputs in the farming process, which is one of the largest sources of emissions and farming. So the companies that are leading in this space are not only helping to reduce emissions by increasing efficiency and how we use these chemicals, but they're also saving farmers and therefore their customers on input costs. So this is a really interesting example of almost what you think of as a win win win. It's good for the company playing in this space, because it should lead to increased market share. It's good for farmers, and it's obviously good for the environment if we're being more precise and how we use these inputs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk Yasmine, a little bit too, about the engagement work and sort of go full circle, you know, you opened with what you've done in effectuating change at ExxonMobile., What is your approach to working with companies? What's your process? What's your ideation process to then how you engage with the company to then how you affect change?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it really comes down to taking all of this with an investment foot view. So we're an engagement focus firm. What does that mean? That means in our opinion, whether you own one share, or you own an entire company, you're an owner. Now, most engagement that happens in the asset management community, in my opinion, is really coming from the perspective of quantity, talking to as many companies as possible about as many issue areas.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you see that, for example, and a lot of stewardship reports that come out at the end of the year from asset managers who say, you know, we talked to 25% more companies this year, therefore, we had more engagement. We take a very different approach, we go very deep and very focused, and we're working directly with the companies that we think are really impactful in the spaces that we operate in. So for example, in the energy transition space, what meets the bar for engagement? Well, first, it's deep fundamental work. We're trying to understand where some of these areas around decarbonization link to an unlocking of value. And secondly, it's about, you know, really working closely with the C suite of many of these companies to help them think about affecting their strategy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think the goals can be really wide ranging on one end, it's simply accountability. You know, these are hard strategies to execute for public companies that are focused on quarterly earnings, where these are much longer term strategies in nature. But there's also an acceleration component. Many of the parts of this transition really involve impediments and bottlenecks to the strategic plan. So we sit across the entire ecosystem, and I think can offer some valuable perspective on how best to achieve these long term goals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen there's transformation, you know, companies that are not on the right path, we think, to maximize shareholder value in a world that's decarbonizing and so there's, there's really opportunities there, too, that maybe worth highlighting to bring it to life. Maybe just to play on some of the spaces we talked about. We've actually been working really closely with a number of the executives at large automakers as they think about how to reach their EV goals, given the challenges around creating batteries. And so helping them think through how to source the input parts and how to sort of think about their overall approach to battery plants, and then how to execute on the long term goal of electrifying their fleet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second was really building upon what we've done in oil and gas, which is we've worked with several large oil and gas companies on helping them to measure and ultimately reduce their methane emissions. Most people don't know this, but methane is something like 80 times more potent than CO2, and so has a really meaningful impact when you reduce it. But in all of these cases, since our Exxon engagement, they have all been very collaborative. I think many management companies really welcome the engagement and I think really appreciate the approach we take, which is really focused on how to think about this from a shareholder value lens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYasmine, this is a question coming a little out of left field, but it really is on this topic of engagement and how retail investors can do that. You know, I go to my mailbox, and I often you know, I get shareholder vote, correspondence where I hold stocks, what can the average retail investor do? And to your point who doesn't have the kind of huge holdings where you typically see more engagement? What can they do to have their voice heard with these kinds of companies?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I love this question, because to me, this is one of the most interesting trends happening in investment management. The reality is that our whole public market system is centered around the shareholder. Now, as an individual investor, you own a very small piece, but actually, collectively, individual investors own a tremendous amount of the public markets. In fact, the three largest passive firms in the world own about 20 to 25% of the average S\u0026amp;P 500 company, and who are their beneficial holders? Well as individual investors, in many cases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat I think the first thing to do is actually understand the system altogether, there's 10s of 1000s of votes that come up that public companies, and I'd say about 500 of them are actually focused in areas around the environment, social issues, governance issues, issues that may be really important to you as an investor. And I think it's really first and foremost understanding that. Secondarily, it's understanding how your manager’s voting, you know, you get to pick and choose where you put your money. And I think now there's certainly more choice in the space around managers who may have a\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003edifferent approach to how they support or not support certain proposals that come up for vote at companies. These are happening every year - so I do think a little bit more of knowledge is power. And I think this is actually going to be a really important trend for the next coming years, as retail investors understand that they actually collectively do own a lot of the largest companies in America.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's exciting, it's exciting to hear that there's a way to do these things. And then just last question Yasmine, which is, you know, supply chain strategy. We saw so much disruption, I know, that's something that you had Engine No. 1, have filed as a thematic to do something so just closing thoughts and a little more about that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, we're very excited about this one. This also fits into the bucket of the types of themes we invest in, which are really all about themes that are, you know, long duration and nature, large scale and their size, and I think maybe not perfectly are really understood by the markets. If you think about supply chains, where we're going really has to do with where we've been, which is for the last, you know, let's call it 40 years, companies have been really focused almost exclusively on one thing in their supply chains, which is minimizing cost. And as a result of that, they've moved large portions of their supply chain overseas to lower cost regions, and in many cases, you know, eliminated redundancies and supply chains.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow, what has this done, this has made supply chains more fragile, it's meant that companies are unable to meet supply spikes, and to really be responsive to demand in fact. And so what are we seeing, we're seeing a huge move to re-localizations of supply chains, which has wide reaching implications. This will have investment implications across spaces like manufacturing, automation and innovation, as we think about some of the types of things that are coming back to the U.S. and places like transportation as we think about disrupting how we move goods. And also probably means more jobs in the U.S, so this is a theme we're very excited about. It's actually in our opinion, linked very closely to the idea of the energy transformation, they sort of go hand in hand and this is another kind of example of where we see a pretty pretty big investment opportunity that lies in front of us. In fact, just to put some numbers on it for folks, during COVID companies lost something like $3.5 trillion dollars because of their supply chain disruptions, so this is a conversation truly about economics.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat conversation that was, Yasmine - just incredible to have you on.

Happy Wednesday and welcome once again to Views from Space where we dive into the space economy and where it's headed. This is part of a monthly series presented by Terran Orbital, a manufacturer of small satellites.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm your host Kinsey Grant, and I am so excited to dive into our topics today, as the live title will suggest we have some big ones coming up Deep Space, Mars, Milani, all sorts of great new tech that we're going to be talking about today with our fantastic guests who I'm going to introduce right now. We have Margarita Cardi who is the VP of Programs at Tyvak International, which is the International segment of Terran Orbital, and also with us Franco Perez Lissi, the systems engineer at the European Space Agency. Franco, Margherita, welcome to Public Live. I'm so excited to have you here with us today. How are you doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGood afternoon. All good. How are you doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e: Hi, everybody - Margherita here.\u0026nbsp; Thanks for the invite and it’s evening here but good afternoon to you guys.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, isn't that funny how that works. I'm actually in Los Angeles right now so it's morning here, evening there but you know what? Space – there’s never a bad time to talk about it. So let's dive in. Are you guys ready to get to some big questions today?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, let's go. Right.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll right, great. So I want to start here, with getting a better understanding of what we're going to talk about today, setting the groundwork, and understanding the important context. Space as a topic is I would say often rife with a lot of mystique and, and a lot of fascination that goes along with that. Now in your work developing small satellites Margherita, you are working to make space more accessible and especially when we're talking about making space more accessible, we're talking about deep space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo for our listeners, knowing that this is part of space that's well beyond the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis on the area beyond the Earth Moon system, I would love it if you could just walk our audience through a quick rundown of what you think makes deep space so appealing. And I think appealing in a lot of ways, you know, appealing from just a general interest standpoint, but also appealing as a satellite developer or for a scientific researcher, what makes deep space so interesting to you, Margherita?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, thanks for the question. It is a very nice one. And I have to say that, at the moment, let's say, we are pretty, you know, conscious about the Earth orbit so the Leo and the orbit around Earth, are environments that are quite well known, I would say, at this moment, while the deep space environment is kind of unexplored, or, let's say less explored, this makes this you know, fascinating for the human being in general. And, and of course, the other aspect that I love about this environment is that we are targeting, you know, bodies, planets, asteroids, on whatever that are not really known in terms of structure and also visual impact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the fact is that even if we have some very good assets on the ground that can, you know, do amazing pictures and amazing inspection of some bodies, just when you just get close to that you can really understand what it looks like, in reality. And so this is something that is really fascinating for me personally, but I think that is the driver, you know, for all the people working in the space environment and targeting, you know, the deep space. So there's a, you know, very far away environment with bodies that we really don't don't know yet. And so even in our mission, which we will go to dive a little bit in detail, we are going to a body that we don't really know about, right? So that's the mystery of discovering something new and, and we don't know what to expect. So with that there is like the mystery of that which is driving our, our work and our let's say the way to do satellites to explore this kind of environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. Yeah. Really interesting. And I think that your focus here on trying to know the unknown is certainly going to be a recurring theme that I'm sure we encounter today as we talk Talk about deep space. Franco, I'm curious if you have anything to add about why you think deep space is so interesting and so attractive and intriguing for both people who are just interested in space and also for the Science and Technology communities?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, sure. So thanks very much. Similar to Margherita, I think I had always the interest and ambition to go beyond Earth since we know little about it, which makes it more appealing. And I think the amount of science and technology demonstration potential on this planetary bodies is very large. So we're going beyond Earth, in many cases to study planets or objects of our solar system that could also explain the origin of our universe, and that's making it super cool.\u0026nbsp; I mean, by investigating Mars, we can extract information about how the Earth was or how it will be millions of years. So for instance, we studied the core of asteroids as the one things we’re going to do on our mission, and we could understand the millions of millions of years of history before our universe. So for the mission that we're working on, we're going into deep space with a different objective, we're going there to support the protection of our Earth in case of a closer encounter with a potentially dangerous asteroid. So in this situation, hypothetical by now, we need to deviate the trajectory of an asteroid way before it arrives, two years before. We need to go as far as possible to avoid collision with earth and study these bodies in detail, of course, to get all the tools required. So for me there are planetary defense technology, and scientific interests ongoing. So it's a little bit of a combination.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's really interesting to consider how understanding our past and our origins might help us to be better equipped to handle whatever comes in the future. I find that to just be endlessly fascinating. Now, with both of these answers in mind, I would love it if the two of you could explain a little bit how satellites come into play here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what are some of the use cases for satellites navigating deep space? And I think this would be a great time to talk about some of the focus areas that both of you have and the work that you're doing within the satellite ecosystem. So tell me a little bit about how satellites play into our strategy for exploring deep space – and both of you can feel free to chime in here and share whatever comes to mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMargherita, would you like to kick us off?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sure. So coming to the, let's say, the technology area, of course, as I was saying before\u0026nbsp; the space is kind of a different environment with respect to the Earth orbits, and there are a few things that I would like to stress and to focus on a little bit because these environmental impacts on the design of the spacecraft for a few things, which are crucial. So for the first place, I would say that the radiation environment is different. So let's say in the, in the Deep Space, and in general, out of the atmosphere, there is a radiative environment, which is very peculiar, and it's different with respect to you know, the distance from Earth and from the sun, etc. And so, in the Milan emission, for example, and in the asteroid environment, we have a very peculiar environment, and we have to make sure that our technology, and our systems are able to survive this kind of environment. So, of course, there are some methods in order to ensure that and we are executing an extensive edition campaign on some of the crucial modules of the spacecraft so that we can, you know, try to reproduce on Earth what we will be seeing during the mission. It's not, let's say possible to have a match one to one, but in general, we can have some models that allow us to replicate the environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, thanks to this test, we are able to understand how the systems are responding to the relative environment and so, to be able to implement any mitigation action that we can actually implement on ground before the mission. So, I would say that ideation is one of the main topics that we are focusing on on Milani as well as the navigation because again, we are not in the Earth orbit. So we cannot rely on, you know, existing assets such as the GPS, for example. So, we have to rely on different methods of navigation with which combined to the distance from the Earth. It makes the world aggregation approach pretty peculiar and complex, I would say. So, we have to implement systems that allow us to navigate in such a far and unknown environment and this is kind of something that is putting challenges in our development.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd in this particular mission, in addition to that, the results are another constraint that We have to consider is that the Milani satellite that we are developing as part of the head of mission will not have the capability to directly communicate with Earth. So, we have to rely on the Hara mothercraft for the communication. So, there is a so-called inter-satellite link system that is allowing Milani and Hara to communicate. And then Hara will be, you know, the main bridge to Earth to download the data and the scientific measurements. So, I would say these three things, at least from the Milani point of view, and then we will see what Frank was saying about the overall mission. But these three challenges are the ones that at the moment are really, you know, adding challenges and pushing the development to a more extreme, let's say level, I would say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight, right. I imagine that that tremendously complicates things. And I would love to dig in a little bit more to this Milani mission, the Milani CubeSat mission. Franco, if you don't mind, could you tell us a little bit about the purpose of the mission? What are the scientific objectives for the Milani mission?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, for sure. So, the main scientific objectives of the mission are mainly related to characterize the binary asteroid surface of Deimos, you see now a hyperspectral camera on board a CubeSat. So, the size objectives are split in three. So, the first one is to map the composition of the Deimos, just to understand, which is the content inside the asteroid to be able to respond. As I said before, if an asteroid is coming to the earth, we need to hit it, we need to change the trajectory. So we need to understand first, the materials and what we're finding when we get there, that is determining the mineral composition difference between the two objects.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mentioned that this is a binary asteroid, a binary means that probably there is a main body and then there is a small asteroid orbiting around the main body as a moon. So we need to determine if there are differences in mineral composition. And also determine the surface roughness and regolith grain size, what we call the surface made out of boulders, it's compact material, etc. So that will give us a good understanding of how strong we need to hit the Astro, for instance, to change the trajectory, and so on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo mainly you are familiar with the dark mission that our mission was a NASA mission that was launched a few months ago, and also a few months ago, it impacted the moon. So this mission was demonstrating the first step of the whole space safety program, which was hitting the asteroid and now characterizing what is the aftermath of this technology, right? So this is when Milani will come into play. So basically Milani, once we arrive with the main spacecraft, Milani will be deployed in the asteroid vicinity, we will be flying around the asteroid and take your images in different spectral ranges to understand all these objectives that we mentioned before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it really is fascinating stuff and I appreciate all the context here and explaining the, you know, real world real life use cases for all this that’s happening. I know that for a lot of people out there, myself included, it can be difficult to completely understand the scope of some of these projects that are happening in deep space. So I appreciate the attention to detail and helping me understand them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow, I would love to transition here for a minute to talk about the big picture relationships that make all this happen. We were talking here about the Milani mission, this is a collaboration between your two organizations. And I understand that for much of our modern history, when it comes to space exploration, we hear about competing ambitions from different nations, you know, it's one nation trying to beat another to a certain space milestone. But I understand now that it comes down to a lot more collaboration than that when we're talking about real space exploration and real, you know, major innovation in space, in deep space. So tell me a little bit about how that has worked, you know, this collaboration between Tyvak and with the ESA, tell me how these relationships have evolved to be a little bit more global, as we tried to navigate what comes next and what we need to do next when it pertains to deep space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, I can start answering the question, if you don't mind. So, from my perspective, I have to say that I need to take a little step back in the sense that in Europe, let's say in the last, I would say 10 or 20 years, I'd say that the space environment has been evolving a lot. So historically, there were you know, big space companies, which were you know, getting the majority of the industry at the end on the market and say in the last decades, these small companies, let's say small space companies started to grow, and to have the place, you know, in Europe and and now we can demonstrate that also the medium company as we are, can really do a lot of things for the Europe and for the European Space Agency in general. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe example of Tyvak International is pretty useful to understand this trend, because we were born in 2016 and we were just, you know, three or four employees and now we count 50 people and we grew organically in the European ecosystem I would say of companies, and all our employees are from Europe. Actually, most of them are Italian at the end. And our supply chain is mostly European and Italian. And so we are actually bringing value to the European ecosystem. And, this program demonstrates that, you know, small companies as we are can act as prime contractors. So for Milani, we act as the prime contractor for the European Space Agency, and so we had this amazing opportunity three years ago to start this very challenging project and for which I will never stop to thank ESA for this opportunity because now this is possible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd it's happening more and more in different projects and, of course, Italy, as always plays a good role, because of course, we have one of the main contributors to the space ecosystem in Europe. And again, working on this program and on other programs that we did in the past it’s challenging and it’s of course having a, you know, a very demanding customer. But I also found in the ESA team, you know, very pragmatic people very prepared, and so the collaboration between the two teams is amazing for this project in particular, I will never stop saying that, you know, the relationship and the collaboration and the pragmatic approach, when everything happens is is really is really awesome. I would say I have never seen something like that before and I'm pretty grateful for that, in this occasion. So that gives me the opportunity to thank again, ESA for that and saying that as my example, I mean, our example as a small company in Italy, working on these small satellites, you know, we demonstrated that we can do more, and we will be growing in the in the future, let's say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, very, very interesting to hear that. And I think that you know, Margherita, it's very obvious and hearing that answer that collaboration is an enormous part of what both of your companies are doing or both of your organizations are doing. So I appreciate you sharing that. Now finally, to close out today, we'd like to do a little myth busting to talk about some of the biggest myths or misconceptions about space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd today we'll talk about Deep Space, particularly, but I'd love to ask both of you. Do you have any misconceptions about the space industry that you want to reset the narrative or set the record straight? Anything that you think people get wrong about space that you would like to set them right off? Franco, would love to kick off here with you anything you want.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, so I'm not sure if it misconceptions, but I think probably there are many aspects of Space Science or space technology that people tend to underestimate because probably they don't understand how complex they are. And I would like to focus on two probably two aspects. So the first one is the space environment. So Margherita was mentioning it before a little bit, but within the low earth orbit, when we are close to the Earth, we are protected by the magnetosphere which protects the Earth from high energy particles. Therefore the environment is more, let's say, adequate for satellites. But when we go beyond, and also that applies also for human spaceflight, so when when astronauts go beyond, things are starting to get a little bit more complex because we don't have that protection of the earth Magnetosphere, and we start interacting with particles that can hit our electronics, deposit a lot of energy and create like break the electronics or create overcurrent over voltages etc. So there is a large complexity in designing and mission that goes beyond, not only because we're going far from the earth and the communications are harder and so on, but also because of the environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the second topic that I would like to also highlight is people usually tend to underestimate the complexity of how hard it is to navigate in space. So we don't have GPS or we don't have our iPhones or Android phones with Google Maps there. But what we have is the stars, and we have the knowledge of our position in the universe so that what we call G and C is guidance, navigation and control of the spacecraft is one of the most complex disciplines. And it's amazing how we can actually help the NASA Dark mission there. So basically, we launch a rocket from the earth, and we can hit an object with an accuracy that is amazing. And that object is probably 200 Million (kilometers) away from Earth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that is something that I think people tend to underestimate and how complex it is to hit that target from 200 million kilometers away. So these two aspects for me are things that usually I get questions about. And I think Tyvak is doing an amazing job on both domains, so on the radiation on the environment, etc, designing a robust mission, but also on the guidance and navigation and control to navigate the cube sat around around the authoring system.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely and I appreciate you sharing that. Margherita, anything you would like to add here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaybe just a couple of more generic points, of course, I fully agree with what Franco said. And maybe something that also people tend to not really fully understand because they are not working on them on this domain is that, you know, space is useless, and there are a lot of problems on the earth so we are wasting money and time working on space missions. And, you know, this is this is, this is a common feeling for people that are not working on the domain. And I would say that, you know, that's not fully true. And in the sense that working on the space, as demonstrating to have a social return, you know, of investment and competencies and knowledge also for on more ground application, I would say.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo based on the different domains and applications, this is kind of something that is now demonstrated. So this is one of the topics that I encounter more and more when I deal with this kind of discussion, having dinner with friends that are not doing this job. And so this is one of the things that I keep stressing with these people that are more external to the space environment, and also that the space, you know, it's accessible to very few people. And it's something that is, again, not accessible. And, again, we spoke about that at the beginning of this half- hour together. But we demonstrated that this is not true anymore. And small satellites, more launchers have opened a big door to space to basically everyone. So I appreciate it's like a complex domain. But you know, the doors now are open to everybody. And so this was not like that 10s of years ago, but now, with the new space economy, this is starting to be a reality. And so everybody can really access space, if they want. So I will say these two topics are our most of the discussion that I have with, you know, people that are not working in this domain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, I appreciate that context, too. And I think that one of the big lessons or takeaways here that I've had from this conversation is understanding that so much of what is going on in deep space really can have implications and impacts on the way that we go about living here on Earth, and I think that that's really, really interesting.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo with that, I would love to thank both of you, Margherita and Franco for joining us today.

I'm your host Ann Berry. Last year in 2022 only 71 companies IPO’d or went public, much lower a comparison with the 2021 surge of new listings. Since IPOs tend to represent a growth investing opportunity and untested companies, market optimism can play a big role in how IPOs are timed and ultimately received by the market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFollowing the optimism of 2021 and the volatility of 2022, let's unpack what experts predict could be in store for the IPO market or Initial Public Offering market in 2023. Our guest today is Nick Einhorn the Vice President of Research at Renaissance Capital, which issues the dollar IPO ETF, the only ETF focusing exclusively on the U.S. IPO market. It does so by providing investors with access to U.S. listed newly public company stocks in one security. Nick, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks. Thanks for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick, great to have you. Let's jump right on in and just unpack some of the stats together. Last year 2022 had a historically low rate of IPOs, so 71, to be exact. And with anything, but especially when it comes to investing, context is key. So I'd love it if you could walk us in the community through some of the challenges that companies were seeing in 2022 and what changed relative to that peaky period of 2021.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight, so as you say, a lot depends on what happened in 2020, 2021. Really the surge we saw in the markets, but especially in high growth tech stocks, for example, other riskier stocks, riskier assets, how much excitement there was around those and those years, and that drove a lot of the boom of 2021 IPO issuance. We had almost 400 U.S. IPOs, which is the highest it's been since the internet bubble 2000. And then really, things have flipped or flipped around in 2022. Largely because performance started to drop off towards the end of 2022..or sorry, towards the end of 2021 for those high multiple stocks. A lot of the sectors that had surged during 2021 started to turn around, and really started falling throughout all of 2022 and some of that was fears about recessions, the Fed raising interest rates, the war in Ukraine certainly contributed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so there's kind of a perfect storm of stocks starting to fall. And the new issues that did come out in 2022 didn't perform well, and so that caused investors to lose interest in the IPO market or stay on the sidelines. And so, at the same time, companies were hesitant to come public in that kind of environment, so a lot of them put their plans on hold, and ended up sitting out the year. So that kind of really just led to, like you said, only around 70 IPOs, which is the lowest number we've seen in the 30 years we've been tracking the IPO market in the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you use that dreaded word bubble right to describe some of 2021 and some of the going public activity then. But when we look in 2022 and the companies that did make it out into the public market, were there any things that those companies had in common? Where were they from specific sectors or stages of maturity, or specific industries? Was there something that enabled those that did go public to make it through the process?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, a lot of them were more mature companies, so less risky than your typical IPO. For example, we saw some large spin offs. Corebridge, which was the spin off of the insurance company AIG, Mobileye, a spinoff from Intel, so businesses that were well known by investors already from being part of large public companies. So that was one area, we saw some strength in specific sectors like energy. Given that energy prices were strong last year, we did see a few energy IPOs come out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe continue to see biotech issuance just because those are companies that really are more than most companies, need the cash from an IPO to fund drug development. So some of those may have preferred to wait too, for a better environment that you needed the cash to fund their trials. And, yeah, where we really saw the biggest drop off was in, you know, traditional VC backed tech, internet companies, software companies, and then some of the large LBOs. I think we saw no private equity backed IPOs last year, which was a fairly astounding fact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe kind of saw the opposite,,some take privates, right, because instead of taking public companies private instead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. I mean, you know, those private equity investors will look to where the sentiment is. And it saw last year, certainly later in the year, especially as a buying opportunity, given all the stocks that had been had come down a lot in price. And so, you know, I'm sure they're hoping that they're going to start seeing improvement in the market soon as they can take those public again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick, it's so great to have some of the context that you've provided. Let's shift now to how you and your colleagues at Renaissance Capital are thinking about what's ahead for the IPO market this year in 2023. Do you think we're going to see a flat year relative to 2022? Up, down directionally where are you thinking we're heading?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo our view is that obviously a lot will depend on what happens in the broader markets. But our basic expectation is that things will improve from 2022. But it will be gradual over the course of the year. And we won't get back to kind of normal levels of issuance until late in the year. Certainly, if not, you know, and maybe not even until next year, but we're hoping kind of later this year. And a lot is going to depend again, if the, you know, we want to see the broader market stabilizing, hopefully, the recession fears cool a bit. And we do see kind of a little more, some of the investor confidence come back into some of the sectors that have been the most hurt during the downturn.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut one thing we've learned from historical study of the IPO market is that periods of slow issuance often tends to produce strong IPO returns. A little counterintuitively, but it's really just because in the slow periods, buyers have a lot of the same power. So, they can really set the price on new issuance and make sure that IPOs are coming out at attractive valuations with clean governance structures, the companies kind of need to give those incentives to buyers to appeal to them. So hopefully, that when we come, these come public, the returns are good. And that, you know, increases interest in the market from both issuers and investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think we did start to see a little bit of that in the last few months, for example, Mobileye, the Intel spinoff, came public late last year, traded quite well up 40% or so right now. We saw a small insurance company come public last week, that's up over 20%, I believe. So I think we're starting to see some of those green shoots. And I think it will kind of gradually happened over the course of this year that we'll see more of those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOne of the things that we saw Nick, and you opened with this was the death of the going public and the real harm, in terms of the reduction in the share prices of a lot of businesses, particularly in that tech and growth area, which did not have profitability. And we're projected to burn cash for quite a long time. Do you think there'll be appetite for those types of companies to go public this year?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think it will depend on the company. Certainly, I think we've seen a lot of those private companies have shifted their mindset from kind of growth at all costs, which may have been in 2020, 2021. So more of a focus on how do we get to profitability, or at least, you know, break even. I think for the right story, investors will be willing to consider companies with losses, but I think it's going to need to be a kind of compelling story. And then, I think kind of bigger than that is just a question about valuation. Because companies that did private rounds, you know, in the last several years, often did those at very high valuations. And so if they're trying to come public today, that valuation might not be available in the market anymore. And so they have to kind of decide, do they want to wait and hope that they can, you know, grow some more and that the market will improve? Or do they want to bite the bullet and just recognize that, you know, there's no sense in waiting forever, and that if you can come public at a multibillion dollar valuation, it's still, you know, there's still a benefit to that, even if it's not quite what you're looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so I think we have seen some of the private companies have taken those steps to reset expectations, for example, Instacart lowered its internal valuation several times last year, I think, from around 40 billion to in the 10 billion range. So they're clearly looking at, you know, the reality on the ground and saying, if we're going to if we're going to come public, that's going to be the valuation we're going to be able to get in this market.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eInstacart is one specific example. Nick, thanks for taking us there. Because I'd love to just go through with you a couple of other specific companies that might go public this year. Some that are rumored to be planning IPOs are also Stripe, Discord, Reddit, TikTok coming out of Bytedance, the parent company, Epic Games. Of these maybe others, are there any that you think are potentially more likely to IPO a better position to do so than others?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's always hard to say with specific companies. I do think that some of these have been rumored IPOs for a while now. And part of my feeling is that if they didn't want to come public in 2021, when the market was super hot, you know, I'm not convinced they're gonna want to come this year. But I think some of these might be certainly IPO candidates. I'm sure they're watching the markets and eyeing the environment. But there are a lot of names that we track and I think some of them, like Instacart, like I mentioned, is one that we think is decently likely to come this year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere's some specific areas like there's a few big semiconductor companies that have been talking about IPOs and that's been an interesting area for investors in recent years. Cybersecurity is an area that I think has gotten a lot of attention lately. And there are some candidates in there like Arctic Wolf Networks, Lacework, Net Scope. So those are some names that I think, you know, could be coming. We have had a few big filings in recent months, for example, Kenvue which is a Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson spin off of consumer products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOverall, there's just a lot of companies that are going to be monitoring the situation, and as things hopefully improve, I think some of them will, will kind of move forward with plans that they've been shelving for, you know, a year now or so.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk a bit more specifically, Nick, about what Renaissance Capital is focusing on. It’s the only ETF that's focused on tracking newly public companies. Could just define for us what newly Public means within what timeframe recently?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEssentially, it's designed to provide investors with exposure to a portfolio of the largest and most liquid, newly listed IPOs. And so we're looking at a time frame of three years, basically, from when a company enters the index to leaves it. I mean, kind of view that as you know, that's an area of stage of life, where companies might not be included in major indices yet. So really, if you want to get exposure to that side of the market, our ETF is a way to do that. And basically, we take the IPO market, we try to cut off at about 100 million deal size, and then only talk at the top 80% and serve the market. And so the rationale is to provide exposure to the most liquid names within the IPO space. So we're, as opposed to maybe some of the small issuers that are a little low liquidity. And yeah, so and again, so that's for U.S. listed IPOs, including foreign companies that may list in the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe way we think about it is, you know, most investors are going to own, you know, funds that give them exposure to the broad equity markets, maybe it's, you know, the S\u0026amp;P 500 or other indices. But the challenge with those is that those tend to hold very mature companies, especially the S\u0026amp;P or the Dow, obviously, but other ETFs as well will hold, tend to add companies several years after they list and in some cases, you know, many years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, when we look at the IPO market, we think that's not really being captured in traditional investment products, investment funds, just because those companies are usually not added to major indices early. So we look at that IPO ETF as a way to kind of complement an existing portfolio of other stocks to really get exposure to the whole IPO or to the sorry, to the whole equity markets, you need to have some exposure to IPOs. And certainly investors can do their homework and can look at individual offerings, and kind of assess the risks and rewards of those. And, you know, we certainly encourage that with some of our other products like our IPO Pro, which is a product designed to trap the IPO market for active investors. But for those who kind of don't want to be doing that work, frankly, the IPO ETF is kind of just a way to get exposure to the broader IPO market\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the index based approach, Nick, just walk us through the benefit of that. It’s a little bit taking the work out of it to your point, but what else should we be thinking about when we're looking at ETFs and the benefits of having an index based system?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eExactly. It's designed to be, you know, entirely rules-based. So it's very transparent. And again, you can look at our website and the documentation there. At our firm a lot of our business is looking, you know, doing active fundamental research on IPOs for our institutional clients. And so there's certainly, you know, we certainly value the benefit of doing research on individual IPOs. But for a broad portfolio, we think that that kind of rules based approach, we're really capturing the whole IPO market in a way that we think makes sense and we're waiting based on floats or kind of capturing the liquidity of the market, we think that makes sense for investors who just want exposure to the broad IPO market.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick Einhorn, VP of Research at Renaissance Capital.

I'm your host Ann Barry and thrilled to join you right now. Today's guest is Kayvon Mohajer, Co-founder and CEO of SoundHound, which you guys can find under the ticker S-O-U-N. SoundHound is a voice artificial intelligence platform that helps smart devices, TVs, cars, and restaurants deliver conversational AI experiences to their customers. Kayvon it is such a pleasure to welcome you to Public Live. Thanks for joining.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you for having me!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, well, let's tee this up by talking about the fact that the concept of artificial intelligence, or AI, is something that has been getting a lot of attention, particularly recently with the breakout success of open AI, chat GPT, which is something we've talked about a lot here on Public Life. We can touch on that later in the discussion if you'd like. But before we dig into artificial intelligence in general, would you mind just giving listeners a little bit of background on Soundhound and what the business does?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I started three companies in undergrad and but after I graduated, I decided that I wanted to be a technical founder of a super high-tech company that would make a big impact in the world. So I went to Stanford University, and I got my Ph.D. in electrical engineering. And as I was looking for that, what would that next big change would be? I turned to science fiction, and in particular, Star Trek; I said, what do they have in stock? We don't have obvious answers like spaceships that go faster than light and teleportation and holodecks and replicators. But the one that was less obvious was voice AI. So the ability to talk to computers and robots and devices and rooms and have a natural conversation with them and ask them to do things and ask them to answer questions. And I thought that's something that would happen, for sure. And in my lifetime, and without conclusion, I started working from a dorm room at Stanford with my co-founders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Because science fiction does tend to become science fact over time. Right. That's, that's the old adage. So fast forward to today. Kayvon, you're out of your Stanford dorm. Talk to us about how the market for voice AI has evolved and what exactly SoundHound is doing. What does the product actually deliver?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eWe spent the first 10 years in stealth, so we kept to the secret. And we wanted to own the technology and make it better than anything else that was out there, and it took 10 years. But we finally achieved that milestone, and we unveiled it a few years ago. And today, we are one of the few companies that completely owns the full stack of voice AI and conversational AI in-house. So there are a lot of players. But most of those use a platform like ours. And we are one of the very few technology providers. And one of the unique attributes of SoundHound is that we aim really high. And we solve super complex problems that push the boundaries of what is possible. For example, what others are trying to do is they want to make computers catch up to humans in language understanding. But our goal is to make computers better than humans so they can do things that humans cannot do. And we are able to support really complex conversations. And that can make people more productive and make the world a better place. And I'll give you an example. Let's say you are looking for a restaurant and you had Chinese food yesterday. So you don't want Chinese food today. You still don't ask a personal assistant to show me restaurants except for Chinese because you don't think they will work. You kind of have learned the boundaries of where they fail and you just operate in that boundary. You ask them simple questions based on keywords. And if you do ask them to show me restaurants except for Chinese, they all say here are some Chinese restaurants where they actually give you the opposite of what you want. But without technology, you can say here's an example actually works. Today Show me Asian restaurants in San Francisco, excluding Chinese and Japanese, and only show the ones that have more than three stars and are open after 9 pm On Wednesday, and you get exactly what you want. Then you can follow up and refine it, and you have a conversation in a complex conversation. So most of our customers choose us because of our superior tech. But they also choose us because you're an independent provider of voice AI. So we don't hijack their brand, product, user, and data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eSo Keyvan, give us a really specific example of that, to bring this to life for the community. So you just gave the example where voice AI was effectively being used for search, right, that you are articulating, I want to find a restaurant with this cuisine in this area. In that example, who is your client? Is it the search engine is that the restaurant and into what device or into what platform is the user speaking to get that search result?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo we power devices and services. So with our cars, TVs, IoT devices, appliances, and those are the endpoints to interact with, you know, these domains. And then we also power services. So, for example, for restaurants. When was the last time you call the restaurant to place an order and you had a good experience, they usually don't pick up the phone. And when they pick up the phone, they are very distracted; it's noise in the background, and they are serving people walking in. And our solution addresses that problem. We take over their phone line; we always pick up the phone so you don't miss restaurants don't miss on any calls. And we give a really good experience for every user. We take their orders, we answer their questions, upsell people and give them recommendations. So we power products and services. And we have this ecosystem vision where we bring them together. So the services that we've voice-enabled now can be accessed by the users of products like you're driving your car, you can order food, you can book appointments, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berr: \u003c/strong\u003eGot it. I mentioned at the beginning that you do service smart devices; you've repeated them: TVs, autos, and restaurants came on to give us a sense of how big your addressable market is, how far you've penetrated it, and how much room there is left to run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThe voice AI category in the stock market is estimated to become 160 billion. And if you include search and monetization, you know that search is today keyword based. And Google makes a lot of money for keyword-based because people search with keywords advertisers bid on those keywords. If you include the concept that the next generation of searches conversational AI and comes from advertising, it will be much bigger than that. And there are very few providers because of the high barrier to entry. And today, we powered millions of products. The power of Vizio TVs, for example, they're the second-largest TV maker in the US. Just in the last few years, we have 17 car brands have chosen SoundHound, which is very impressive. And beyond TV and automotive, the power products like Snapchat, and Pandora, we work for companies like Netflix and MasterCard to become a robust IoT (Internet of Things) devices. We announced a strategic partnership with Qualcomm to integrate voice AI into their Snapdragon chipsets and the new Italian service fee analysis that sounds for restaurants that I just talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat overview. It's incredible to hear just how far SoundHoud has come from that 10 years and stealth to now having a public company out there and in full visibility. Let's talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within Voice AI. Can you talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within voice? Can you talk about whether you've seen the market for voice AI tech become a bit more crowded and how SoundHound has kept its edge and a competitive advantage?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I usually, so there are a lot of players in voice because Voice AI is happening, and people are adopting it, and there's a big demand for it. But there's a high barrier to entry. So the core technology providers in voice AI, I will say, a handful at a global scale. I usually say it takes 10 years to create voice AI technologies. And it takes three years to realize it will take 10 years, so I've seen several companies with resources start on the pack and then abandon it. So there's a really high barrier to entry, and as a platinum provider in multiple languages in multiple regions, multiple industries. Soundhound is very unique. So we support about 25 languages. We support multiple industries. We are in Asia; we are in Europe, we are in North America and South America, and we claim to be the best tech. And again a lot of customers are to choose us mainly for the quality of the tech. And the fact that you're independent and we don't hijack their brand and users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCould you talk a little bit cable and about how voice AI benefits consumers now and maybe in the future, and just what are some of the more surprising applications that, you know, the average person doesn't really know about yet? What are the hidden nuggets of the use cases that you've seen in your experience?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eI would answer that question by explaining our three-pillar business strategy because it's very innovative. You know, we've been innovating in the tech, but we also try to be innovative in the business. And the three-pillar business strategy is the answer to that. So let me explain what that is. So in the first pillar, we power devices and products like cars, TVs, and IoT devices. There will be 75 billion IoT devices projected by 2025. So the order of magnitude is larger than smartphones. And most of these devices don't have either the physical room or economical room to add, like a touchscreen or keyboard, or mouse. But the microphone is small and inexpensive. And that's all it takes to add voice to these products. So 75 billion devices, from cars, TVs, IoT devices, and appliances, can be voice-enabled. That's our pillar one. And the business model before that is very proven, you know, we get a royalty. And then we have edge and cloud. In the second pillar, we power services, like food ordering for restaurants and customer service, and think of restaurants as what books spread on Amazon. So Amazon started by selling books. They only did that a lot of people knew Amazon as an online bookstore. And when they did that really well, they did more things. And now they sell everything from A to Z. So for restaurants, there's a very complex problem. We have a lot of focus on that now. And then we'll expand to other areas. So that would be pillar two. So pillar one, and pillar two, are very, very proven business models; they don't depend on each other success of one doesn't depend on the success of the other one. And the third pillar is when we bring them together. So we bring the services that the voice-enabled to the products that be voice-enabled. And that creates a commerce ecosystem. So while you're driving your car, you can talk to your car to control the air conditioning and the radio and navigation, then you can also order food, conveniently and from restaurants that we are both enabled. And this ecosystem benefits everyone. Users, who are the most important part of the equation, are delighted because of the convenience and speed of ordering. Restaurants are happy because they get new leads from the ecosystem. And there's a lead revenue that they share with us. And then, we share that revenue with the product leaders with that car maker with the TV maker. And they benefit as well because, in many cases, they are able to generate incremental recurring revenue for the first time from the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eFascinating; it's been such an interesting part of the debate around AI lately, lots of conversation, talking about how the users of these new technologies are going to have to think perhaps much differently about privacy, or bias, or other ethical topics. When it comes specifically to voice AI and everything that you've seen. What are maybe some of the challenges through that ethical or privacy-focused lens that your space faces?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, yeah, so those are big challenges. And they're distinct challenges to privacy is one and bias another one. So we've seen, you know, videos and write the news when you know AI does says the wrong thing or unacceptable things undesired outcome, those happen, and the privacy's and other things like devices are always listening. So on the privacy side, that's one of the advantages that we deliver to our customers: we let them define their privacy policy and let them be as transparent as they want. And as restrictive as they want. In the way, they integrate both AI. And that's one of the disadvantages that, for example, if they get it from the big tech, they just inherit their privacy policy; whatever it is, they can't really control it. So we give flexibility to our customers. And one of the areas that can address privacy concerns is the recognition of the edge. So there's the cloud, and there's the edge so, so you're increasingly seeing both demand from our customers and our ability to run everything on the edge. So, for example, that user's voice doesn't need to leave the device, and then you can have devices that always listen without sharing your audio with third parties. On the bias. That's another challenge. And we are committed to being a pioneer in addressing those challenges. Our approach is that we combine machine learning models and software engineering algorithms to create our solutions. And the software sets the boundaries for the machine learning models. And then machine learning models are companions that make our solutions better within those boundaries that are set by our software engineers. So most of these undesired outcomes, and these are scenarios that you see in the news and other demos, are when machine learning models don't have boundaries, and then they learn from bad data, and then they have unpredictable behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eTo wrap everything together, Keyvan, what are some of the priorities that you and your team have in 2023 and beyond were the big growth opportunities that you guys are looking to lean into?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo the world has changed. And we are adapting and transforming to the change changes. We are transforming to be a much more financially efficient organization by reducing our costs while still growing our revenue at a very healthy rate. And our goal is to become profitable and cashflow positive within this year. We announced at the end of Q3 of the year, in quiet periods after only us will be publicly disclosed last time end of Q3 we had over $300 million of booking backlog. These are from committed customers. So we have a really solid foundation for our revenue growth with our reduced costs and increased focus. We believe we will increase our revenue growth this year, and we'll achieve our goal of becoming cash flow positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThese are big goals, and wishing you all the very best of luck as you pursue those. Just thank you again, Keyvan Mohajer. For everything you shared with us, and your insights, it has been a long journey and really ahead of the explosion in interest.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eHello everybody and welcome to Public Live. I'm your host Ann Berry and looking back, it has been a bit of a bumpy and unpredictable year in the markets. But some pockets did see momentum, one of them being electric vehicles, which stand to benefit potentially from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed earlier this year. So that's what we're going to focus on today, electric vehicles or EVs, their latest developments, and what's on the horizon as we head into 2023. Here to discuss all of this is Jay Jacobs, US head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares. Jay, welcome back to Public Life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd thanks so much for having me. It is great to be back on Public Live for one more time in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eI cannot believe 2022 is nearly over. I feel like the EV sector share, when you look at their share prices, are probably pretty glad that we're going into a new year, a new chapter, and putting this one behind us definitely had a busy couple of years, we have seen looking back at this year an increased interest from consumers, two major ride-hailing companies all promising to adopt electric vehicles into their fleets and the industry has been one that just can't seem to slow down. So I'd love to kick off today's show with you by walking through some of the highlights that you've tracked from the last year in the sector.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I would say there are a few things. You know, first off, this was really kind of the year where EVs became less of a niche product and more of a mainstream product. We see that in adoption numbers. So if you look at the first half of 2022, EVS made up 26% of car sales in China, about 20% of passenger car sales in Europe, and the US actually lagging behind by only about 6%. But that is still very big numbers in a very large market around the world, showing that EVs are really coming onto the scene in a meaningful way. You add, on top of that, that we've had several car models come out this year. So basically, every major car brand has an EV now, and you see, it's not just sports cars, SUVs, it's vans, it's lower price sedans, really a model for every kind of buyer and price point out there. And then finally, yeah, we have the Inflation Reduction Act, which is one of the largest commitments ever to support the adoption of electric vehicles and clean energy, about $370 billion from the US government over the next 10 years or so, which is going to provide things like subsidies for building EV subsidies for buying EVs to really accelerate the growth of this segment. So it was, yes, 2020 was a difficult year for almost any investor in any segment of the market. EVs not being the exception. But there were a lot of things to still get excited about in the Eevee space and 2022.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eJay, let's break down a little bit more the legislation and hone in on the role of the Inflation Reduction Act. You hit the headlines for $370 billion over how long is that investment going to be made?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it's roughly over about 10 years. This doesn't all get spent at once. And that's kind of the design, right, is that what the IRA is trying to do is accelerate the adoption of a technology that otherwise is seeing good adoption, but the US government wants to do it faster. And there are really two different ways to do that. One is increased demand. And the easiest way to increase demand is to make something cheaper. So the way that they're doing that is a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, a $4,000 tax credit for used EVs, spurring demand by making them more affordable. The other way to do that is to increase supply. And that's actually incredibly important in the market that we're in today. Because there are actually not enough EVs to buy right now. If you try to buy a Ford F150 Lightning, you can't do it. If you want to buy, you know, some of the top models, you know, model three long ranges and make Mustangs, there are long waits, if you can even get on a waitlist right now. So the idea is, how do we spur more supply by using things like incentive tax credits and production tax credits to get these companies to build more manufacturing plants in the United States as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting that you break down the demand and supply aspects of it so succinctly, Jay. When you think about which of those pieces are going to have the nearest term momentum, tax credits for purchasing EVs, when are they going to kick in, and then subsidies for buying more EV plants? When are they going to start getting kicked in?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen the tax credits get hit as early as next year? The tax credits for building manufacturing plants could also start to come into play next year. But you know, we have to realize building a manufacturing plant is a two to three-year, four-year process even so we're not really going to see the commercial benefits of that for some time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's let's look a little bit more at trends for 2023, specifically Jay, which industries are looking to add EVs to their fleets? The famous one, of course, was Amazon, which had an agreement with Rivian to try and bring EVs into their delivery fleets. What are the other examples that you can walk us through of different industries moving into electric vehicle adoption?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think two are really exciting right now. So one is when we look at semi trucks, so the 18-wheelers you see on the highway, very expensive vehicles that use a lot of gas. We're starting to see progress in the electrification of that fleet. And astute listeners may have noticed the Tesla semi has been tested on the roads recently, with companies like PepsiCo putting in orders for dozens of Tesla semis going forward. So that's a really exciting development in switching the fleet from gas to electric. And then secondly, this just came out yesterday; the US Postal Service, which is the biggest operator of vehicles in the federal government in the United States, is going to put in place about 66,000 electric vehicles over the next decade or so. So this is massive, this is going from, you know, just electric vehicles being kind of a niche sports car, to really being the predominant form of passenger vehicles or light-duty vehicles or even heavy-duty vehicles and the Tesla semi example going forward. So these are exciting times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is x 1000s. Quite the number doing know, Jay, which manufacturers and which brands are going to be procured from.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, they're there from a couple of brands. One is Oshkosh, which is more of a military supply company, but builds a lot of postal service car tracks, and the others are going to come from the private sector, more from major car brands even announced which ones yet. Here's the fun fact, though, the little postal service truck that people have seen on the roads for decades only gets about eight miles per gallon. So you can see pretty quickly how switching to an electric really ramps up the efficiency of the postal service not just to reduce emissions, but to reduce operating costs; no longer paying so much for gas can actually really lower costs for shipping.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk a little bit about EV stocks, Jay, because for people interested in electric vehicles and looking to play in the market, I'm curious if you'd be able to share some of the high-level signals or metrics that you and your team look for when evaluating EV players?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. So really, the primary thing that we look at is revenue from the EV ecosystem. Now the art in that is really what is the EV ecosystem. It's very obvious to say that EV manufacturers, like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already, are very key to the electric manufacturers like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already are very key to the electric vehicle theme. But it actually goes far beyond that. And so you can think about, you know, who are the companies that actually build the batteries that go into electric vehicles, they're obviously part of the ecosystem, who's doing the lithium mining and processing that goes into those batteries, who's building the electronics and the parts that are supplied into electric vehicles. And there are really dozens of companies beyond some of the headline names that are really participating in the ecosystem. We often call this thematic beta or thematic risk, the risk here being these companies are tied to the potential adoption of electric vehicles. If the adoption for electric vehicles happens the way that we expect it to, these companies will be rewarded for that risk. If electric vehicles get supplanted by new technology, or for some reason, don't make it, they don't get escape velocity, and the internal combustion engine lives on, then companies with this thematic risk would be punished. But what we are really looking at is what are the companies that have that highest thematic risk to the electric vehicle ecosystem. And we really measure that by who gets the most revenue from electric vehicles and the entire ecosystem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd how about in the US versus internationally? I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act here in the US has caused enormous momentum domestically. Are there players you look at or parts of the supply chain that you look at internationally and that are publicly traded?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, this is a theme that is not confined to borders. Yes, we saw, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States. You know, we've seen other efforts in China and Europe to spur greater electric vehicle adoption as well. So it's really a global theme, and we see global companies participating in it. There are a lot of battery manufacturers coming from South Korea and beyond. There are a lot of lithium miners in Australia. There are parts suppliers all around the world as well. So when we think about this theme, we are absolutely looking at it through global hubs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCan we talk a little bit about how EV ETFs work Jay, as an investor, thinking about adding EV exposure to their portfolio\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. So EV ETFs are really trying to get exposure to that EV ecosystem by investing in companies around the world. So, for example, our IDRV ETF and iShares invest in lithium mining companies, refiners, battery producers, and car manufacturers in the electric vehicle space, as well as part suppliers, and really provides exposure to that entire ecosystem in one ETF. This has many benefits for investors, but one of them being it's hard to identify these companies on your own because they're not just US large-cap brand names. It can be smaller international companies. It's just hard for individual investors to access this ecosystem at the individual stock level. Secondly, there's just a lot of efficiency and doing this through an ETF rather than going out and buying 50 companies around the world on your own. You can put in an order for one ETF like IDRV and get exposure to that entire basket with one trade. So, you know, when we design an ETF like IDRV, we're really focused on capturing the pure-play companies across the entire ecosystem of a theme, in this case, electric vehicles, to get that exposure to investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd then, Jay, could you give us a little bit of color on a couple of things that help with the myth-busting? Because EVs have tended to seem like the cars of the future. They're sort of here with us now. But what are some of the assumptions that people may still have about electric vehicles that maybe just aren't true?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think one of the biggest misconceptions is that they're still expensive. Yes, there are EVs at very high price points. But there's actually several models that are coming in below the average purchase price of a new vehicle in the United States, which is about $50,000 these days. On top of that, you have tax credits, which can make them even cheaper. And then, on top of that, you have lower maintenance. So electric vehicles don't need an oil change each year. Actually, through regenerative braking, it's less frequent that you need to do brake pads and brake rotor replacement. No spark plugs to replace every 50,000 miles. So it is already cheaper in many instances to own an electric vehicle than an internal combustion engine when you look at the entire lifetime ownership. So you ought you add all that together. And the economic argument for electric vehicles is really starting to come into the forefront here, which we believe is only going to accelerate adoption. It's not just about is this a better car? Do I like the car? Do I like how it looks? If it is cheaper off the land or cheaper over the lifetime ownership experience? We think that's really going to bring the mass markets into the Evie space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat about Jay, one thing that just come up? Recently, I looked at a company that was trying to find ways to make it easier for Evie owners to be able to charge their vehicles. How about that element? Is the infrastructure going to be there to support getting more electric vehicles on the roads?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's certainly growing. And we've been talking a lot about the Inflation Reduction Act. But another piece of policy in the United States is really accelerating electric charging, which was the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act passed last November. The idea behind that act is to put about seven and a half billion dollars into building 500,000 chargers around the country. So a lot more densification of electric charging. This, in many ways, is basically a subsidy for EV buyers because if there are more chargers and there are faster chargers, in the places that you want to see them. You don't need as big of a battery. And so, if you have a smaller battery, you don't have to pay as much for an electric vehicle. So you can see how different policies from the US government are really trying to accelerate adoption, whether it's tax credits for buyers, whether it's incentives for manufacturers, or building up a charging infrastructure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWith that, I want to thank you, Jay Jacobs, Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares.
