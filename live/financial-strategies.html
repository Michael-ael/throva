For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant and today's show is brought to you by Tema ETFs. Tema ETFs is an issuer focused on bottom-up investing in unique structural themes like their Lux Ticker, that's the, excuse me, their Lux ETF, that's the ticker $LUX and that's what we're gonna be talking about today with our wonderful guests. I'm so excited to welcome Javier Lastra, who is a PM at Tema ETFs to the Public Podcast. Javier, how are you today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJavier Lastra: \u003c/strong\u003eHi, good morning to everyone. Thank you for having me on the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, absolutely. I'm excited to chat with you today. We certainly had a very fun and interesting conversation on deck today. We're going to be talking about investing in luxury, specifically around that $LUX ETF that I mentioned. But I want to start with a little bit of a higher level question here. I want to start with just general luxury as an investing theme. I think often when we, as investors, consider luxury, we're thinking bags, shoes, cars, fancy expensive items that we spend disposable income on, but not necessarily stocks. Now, as the PM of this $LUX ETF, which invests in companies that are operating in the luxury industry, you know, the $LVMH and Mercedes-Benz, et cetera, tell me a little bit more about why this is an appealing sector for retail investors to consider. Why is luxury investing up there with, you know, spending on luxury items? Tell me a little bit more about that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure. I mean, luxury as a theme is a very interesting one from an investment perspective, because there are certain structural tailwinds that help the growth in the space. I think we've all heard many times how, for instance, in Asia, the emerging middle class has been driving the growth of the sector for many years. And there is expectations that will continue to be a tailwind. A sector where it's helped by the fact that, for instance, women, which are the, you know, by and large, the biggest purchases of luxury, they continue to participate in the workforce, they continue to gain further financial freedom, and that's unleashing a lot of financial firepower to spend in luxury goods. We also see across the Western economies that women are also having less kids. That means that there's also increased spending that is unleashed that can be spent, women can spend on themselves. And this is something that is demographically going to help the sector going forward. And that's why we think it's such an interesting thing from an investment perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, certainly interesting aspects to consider. I like this idea of thinking about the tailwinds that might impact this sector. Now, one question that I have that I'm sure a lot of people listening are probably wondering the same thing. You see headlines all the time that say, you know, an Hermès Birkin bag outperformed the S\u0026amp;P 500 by X amount as an investment over, you know, X number of years. I'm curious why invest in an ETF like Lux instead of investing in the actual item itself, investing in a luxury handbag, a luxury car. Why invest in the stock instead of the thing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, an ETF gives you the diversification and the benefit of with one purchase having exposure, not to just one bag, one brand, but you actually get exposure to many different brands, many different objects in many different sectors that actually can, we argue, behave, can behave in a very similar fashion. So, the diversification benefits that bring the fact that you can invest in our fund are not present when you buy an Hermès bag. Clearly, if you're a big fan of Hermès and you want to invest in one, I highly suggest that you do, but I think there are different motivations for it rather than just pure investment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and certainly a little easier to buy an ETF than it is to buy an Hermès bag at the current moment. So I wanna talk about that, that idea that attaining these luxury goods is often something that is not necessarily in the question for a lot of people who might be listening to this at this current moment. We aspire to be luxury consumers, but we might not be in that income tax bracket quite yet. Tell me a little bit about how aspiration plays into luxury as a sector, into its desirability. How does that aspirational quality impact the way that we invest in luxury items and in luxury stocks?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, this is a very good question. I mean, it comes down to the definition of luxury, right? At the end of the day, if you look at watches, you can either buy a, I don't know, a Apple watch or something even cheaper than an Apple watch, a Seiko or a very standard watch that gives you the time and probably very accurately nowadays. Or you can go all the way to the other end of the spectrum and buy a Patek Philippe, which costs in the tens of thousands of dollars or even sometimes in the hundred thousands of dollars. The reason that you're buying that watch is not because you need the time on your wrist, right? The reason you're buying that watch is because it's giving you a status, it's giving you something that no other object is giving you. And that desirability is really what defines a lot of these luxury items. I've made the example of watches, but I think we can think of cars, we can think of boats, we can think of bags, fashion, shoes, anything. There are many industries where this gets repeated with brands that are positioned in that luxury spectrum, which I think they get defined normally by craftsmanship and desirability. Desirability that usually creates demand over and above the supply of the product. And that's why normally you have this second aftermarket where the prices can even be higher than the actual product when the price of the product is new.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eTotally. And I was just the other day speaking with a co-worker. We had listened to, not to plug another podcast on this podcast, but I had been listening to a podcast about the story of LVMH and the Arnaud family. And it came to my attention that this stable of brands that LVMH has collected are all the kinds of brands that have existed for, in some cases, a century plus and have maintained such staying power. And it's really interesting to consider what the next iteration of those kinds of brands might be that stand the test of time, that have this reputation for craftsmanship and for reliability and for that desirable luxury quality. Those tend to be those aspects that really make a brand something that can stand that test of time. It's a very interesting idea to consider what might be the next version of those companies and something I've just kind of been toying with. And one aspect of that conversation around how a brand creates staying power and maintains that desirability, of course has to do with the economic situation that we are in at any given moment. So that's my segue to talk about how luxury stocks might potentially be, you know, something that are recession proof. Tell me a little bit more about the chatter around the idea that luxury can still stand the test of economic time, if you will, and maintain that desirability, maintain that value, despite what might be going on with GDP or unemployment or any economic indicator, what have you. Tell me a little bit about that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. I mean, this comes from the perspective that the average customer is in an income bracket on a wealth bracket that doesn't really get impacted by economic cycles. And therefore, whether they buy one or two Ferraris or three Ferraris doesn't get decided by which part of the economic cycle we are in. Obviously, there are parts of the luxury space. So when you get to the more aspirational side of it, which we've had a little bit of it in the last two or three years, that is more cyclical. And that's, I think, what we've seen at the moment as inflation has spiked. Some of those aspirational consumers that were able to purchase the first luxury item and the last two or three years, they're no longer there. And that part of the market has already been struggling, I think, for a few quarters. Again, there's a big part of the luxury customer base that in revenue terms, that is, as I said, individuals with wealth and income that are in the top 1%, if not higher. And those are generally quite resilient through the cycle. And that's, I think, what most people that talk about this resilience are referring to. There are some numbers that floated around suggesting that around 20% of the top customers generate around 60% of the total revenues of some of these companies. I think that varies across sectors and across companies, but I think that would be an interesting rule to keep in mind that the top customers, the most wealthy customers tend to account for the vast majority of the revenue generated by these pure luxury companies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo with all of this in mind, I'm curious about what you would say to investors who might be considering this space, adding luxury to their portfolios. What would be some of the either homework they should do or questions they should ask themselves before investing in luxury?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, from a US investor perspective, one of the things that we've highlighted is that the access to some of these companies that we invest in is quite limited. The vast majority of the global luxury consumer groups tend to be either trading outside the United States, or they tend to not have also sponsored ADR. So the access to these investments is limited. I think we've calculated that it's around 70% of the pure luxury place globally are actually not accessible for the average retail investor in the United States. So if you are attracted by this luxury, let's say mega trend that we think is very interesting to tap into. I think you really should consider, I guess, our fund, which is giving you access to that exposure. In terms of the questions you need to ask yourself, obviously, you need to look at your portfolio and look at what your exposures, your asset allocation proportions are. We could be, let's say, bundled into consumer discretionary. But as we've argued earlier consumer discretion generally tends to be a lot more cyclical, whilst our subsectors should be, or sector within consumer discretion, should be a lot more resilient through the cycle for the reasons we discussed earlier. So I think this is an interesting angle they can think of if they are concerned obviously about the economy in the next two or three years or even more short term. So I think the qualities of the space, I think it's something to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, well, certainly very interesting and has been an illuminating conversation, obvious to understand a little bit better how and why luxury might be a little more, I guess, recession in elastic than maybe people might consider at first glance. So, thank you so much for your time today and for sharing all of this wonderful information with us. I really appreciate it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you, thanks for having me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course.

Specifically, we're going to talk about how to gauge growth and momentum from reported from public reported data. future growth versus steady slow growth, the difference between growth stocks and value stocks diversification as it relates to growth and value, so we're gonna, it's gonna be a good episode, right? So sit down, put on your listening ears, and let's jump into it. So in my eyes, there are two types of growth. There's financial growth, and there's customer growth. Every three months, publicly traded companies are required to disclose their financials to the public. And usually, a company will report customer data alongside these financials. A good example of this is Disney. They report both their revenue generated from their media and technology business segment, right, Disney Plus, I'm a subscriber, you might be too. That's the financial growth, but they also share the new subscribers that they've added. Right? The customer growth, both of these are important. So how do we begin to understand this kind of growth? What is good growth? And what is bad growth? So the answer for you here, the secret sauce, the magic sauce, year over year, right? This summer did I make more than I did last summer, we're comparing summers because it's irresponsible for us to compare summers to winters, especially from a business perspective. Let's think of an example. If you're a snow cone company, and you're selling snow cones at the beach, you don't want to compare how many snow cones you sold in the wintertime to how many you sold in the summer, right? No one's buying snow cones in the winter, you want to compare apples to apples, that's the year-over-year comparison that we want to be focused on when looking at growth. So publicly traded companies do it the exact same way. They report revenue for this most recent quarter, and they compare it to the revenue they did during the same quarter last year. So let's say a company just reported their earnings results for the quarter. The first thing I'm looking at is the growth in their financials. So specifically, I want to look at this, I want to see the year-over-year growth and the line items on their income statement. I want to look at revenue, operating income, and net profit, I want to see all of these line items moving up and to the right, because if they're not growing their revenue, year over year, they're not growing their operating income near year over year or net profits, there might be a larger underlying problem here. The next thing I'm trying to decipher is where is this growth coming from? or the lack thereof? Right? Is it? Are we growing? And if we're not, but where's it all coming from? Is it coming from net new customers? Or is the company perhaps raising their prices on existing customers? Maybe it's a new product offering or a feature, what is catalyzing the growth that we are analyzing right now, by looking at this, that's going to help us better understand the company's product or service sales cycles if they're speeding up or slowing down, especially during the current macroeconomic climate. So now we understand how growth is defined. We know what line items to look for on the income statement to look for this growth rate, revenue, operating income, and net profit, as well as the different ways to think about growth customers and financials. But now I really want to better understand the speed of growth, right, as well as how the speed of growth might impact the company's valuation and how you might be going about valuing them. So you've all heard of super-fast growth tech companies, I'm sure the ones that are doubling their revenue year over year, they're unprofitable, but they're growing very quickly. Generally speaking, these are defined as growth stocks, right? We might have heard that term on public here or in the headlines, but maybe your friend told you but growth stocks, right, these fast-growing unprofitable companies. However, on the other side of the aisle, we've also heard of the old, tired but very profitable companies who aren't growing, you know, more than call it and mid-single digits every year, but they're doing just fine. And assuming it's undervalued, you can think of those companies as value stocks. So on one side, we get the super fast growing companies, the growth stocks. On the other side, we have the value stocks now. Now you're probably saying which one should I invest in? Well, I can't tell you that but what I can tell you is how you can begin thinking about them. So on one side you have capital appreciation, right? The stock price going up that might come\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eWith investing in a growth stock, and then on the other side of the aisle, you have this more stable cash-flowing business that might even pay you a dividend, right? So you get a bit of cash flow and some potential capital appreciation as well. But which one is right for you? So only, you know the edge of that question. Everyone's investing style is unique to them. But if you're thinking it's a growth company, that's great. Let's talk about a few things to help you evaluate which one you might want to look at. So always want to start with the financials, right? It's usually common and maybe even required for a growth company to be growing revenue by about 30%, year over year. If they're not doing that, maybe that's a red flag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e The next thing I want you to look at is their operating income and their profits, right? Are their margins expanding as well, these are all things to consider when you're looking at a company. Don't forget about those customers, though we have growth companies, they tend to be software companies like to report a specific line item called the dollar-based net retention rates, you might not see this on any financial statements, but it'll likely be brought up in an earnings call or some sort of shareholder letter. Again, that's the dollar-based net retention rates, this usually means that they're able to keep and upsell the customers every year on new products. This number is normally above 100%. But every company is different. These companies also like to report the number of customers that have purchased big contracts for them. So we definitely want to be seeing that number go up, right? The big, big spending customers thumbs up there. But what about the value stocks now, right, we talked about growth, let's talk about evaluating these value stocks. So same deal, you want to think about financials and you want to think about customers, financials, aka revenue, it's probably growing mid-single digits, they're likely cash flowing a bunch of money, right, because they're old and they pay ran for a while they're likely profitable at this point. So free cash flow is likely increasing. And as free cash flow increases, there may be paying down debt, they might be reinvesting that back into the business through capital expenditures, they might be buying back shares, or even paying you a dividend. If a company is paying a dividend, something I want you to look for is growth, right? The continual growth over a long period of time of that dividend. For example, there are companies on the stock market who have been paying and growing their dividend every single year for the last 50 years. They're actually dubbed the dividend kings. And they're really interesting to learn about if you're into that sort of thing. Now, from a customer's perspective, for the value companies, it's probably a similar story, right? Mid-single-digit growth with nothing too crazy happening behind the scenes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e Alright, so now you're probably saying to yourself, I've got growth stocks, I understand, you know, the capital appreciation that goes with them. They're unprofitable, they won't be paying a dividend. We got the value stocks, I understand those as well. But which one is right for me? Which one should I be thinking about? So in my opinion, that all comes down to risk tolerance. Again, I cannot tell you what to do. Neither am I telling you what to do. But this is what I do personally. So I think about my core companies, and I think about my satellite companies. So let's start with the core. My core companies are those value stocks, right? They've been around for decades, they're incredibly profitable, spitting out cash dividends, every quarter, all the boring stuff that you're not going to see in the headlines. But I like that, you know, that makes up a good 60-65% chunk of my investment portfolio. I like to have a good solid chunk in these tried and true companies. So on the other side of that aisle now is the satellite companies, right? Think of this as like little satellites that are orbiting the Earth, right? The earth is all the core companies and these little satellites are the growth stocks. I have exposure to them, especially the ones I'm most intimately familiar with and, you know, keep up with but I'm not betting the farm on them by any stretch of the imagination, they're not profitable, and they still have a lot to prove, etc, etc. So I don't want to be too crazy here. So as you think about diversifying your portfolio, keep that in mind. Think about your risk tolerance, think about your goal as an investor as well as how it all comes together to help you reach financial freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e For all of those of you that stick around this entire time.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eHey how's it going? How's it going? Happy Friday, everyone. I'm super pumped to be back doing these 15-minute fundamentals shows on Public Live. You guys enjoyed season one so much. We had to come back and hit you with the season two. So I am pumped. Welcome to 15-minute fundamentals on Public Live. This is the show where we break down investing strategies and concepts so you can be a better investor. I'm your host Austin Hankwitz and I create personal finance and investing content online. I have a degree in finance and economics, and I did mergers and acquisitions for a publicly traded healthcare company for a few years out of college. So long story short is I'm a nerd, and I embrace it. As a reminder, this show is for educational purposes only. And this is not direct investing advice. Many of the metrics we'll cover today, however, in the shows are available as part of Public Premium, which gives you more ways to level up your portfolio. You can learn more about that and join the waitlist or sign up or do whatever you want to do at public.com/premium. I'm on it. I love it. I enjoy it. Go check it out. public.com/premium.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is the episode right? This episode is all about earnings interpretation. Specifically, what are quarterly earnings reports, the specific information that is shared during these events, and how to go about interpreting them for the first time. So with the groundwork being laid, let's get after it. Kicking things off with what exactly is a quarterly earnings report, right. So if you're watching CNBC right now, or scrolling your public feed, you've likely been reading a lot of financial data. And there's a lot of headlines being thrown at you right now, specifically, as it relates to these publicly traded companies, right? Maybe you've seen someone saying this company came in above expectations and their stock is flying because of it, or this company came in below expectations and their stock is sliding. There's a lot of information being thrown around right now. So let's work together to not only interpret it, but to also think through how it might impact your portfolios.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e Starting at the beginning, right, a publicly traded company is a company whose stock can be bought or sold on the stock market, we all know that we all have brokerage accounts, we get that, right. So think Disney, Amazon, Nike, all that fun stuff. But because these companies are open to the public in the sense that anyone can buy and sell their stock, they have a few responsibilities to uphold as made possible by the SEC, one of those responsibilities is disclosing audited financial information to their investors, right. This is anyone who owns the stock, you, me and everyone else. And so in efforts to do this as efficiently as possible, these publicly traded companies released something called quarterly earnings reports to their public every three months. Because we talk about what's inside of them and how to interpret them, it's important to know where to actually find these things, right. So if we're going to talk about something, I don't want to just say it and then you guys go be puzzled on where to find it. So here are two places where to find this information. Two places where to find these quarterly earnings reports. The first is straight from the SEC website, the Securities and Exchange Commission's website sec.gov. There's a way to search a company name. And, you know, you can read through all the quarterly earnings releases things called like an Edgar, something like that. But you know, be sure to keep an eye out actually for the reports that are labeled as 10 Q's, right? Look for the 10 key of this 8k, 10k, observe the different things, look for 10 Q, that's what you want.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e The second place to find this information is actually on the company's Investor Relations website. So if you're visiting a website, a company's website, it might be hard to find you like the little tab board, it might not just be apparent. So what I do personally, to find this like section of the company's website, is I google the name of the company. So say Amazon, for example, and then the words investor relations after their name. And then I click enter into Google, and the Investor Relations website is usually like one of the first ones to pop up on Google. So once you're in there, you'll be able to find all these earnings reports that we're going to be talking about. So we know what quarterly earnings are, and where to find them. But how should we begin interpreting the information? Right? How should we be approaching this?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eSo let's first start here with what is actually being shared. And there are two things in particular. So the first kind of bunch of things that are being shared here are the financial statements, right, there are three financial statements that you should expect when a quarterly earnings report is being shared. And these three financial statements are all you need as it relates to understanding the financial health of a company, you've got the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. So starting with the balance sheet here, this is where you'll be able to find a company's assets, their liabilities and their owner's equity. Essentially, you know how much money the company has in the bank or the balances of the short and long-term debts as well as the value of their assets like property, equipment, and other tangible and intangible items. Most investors get overwhelmed by all the information shown on this financial statement. I certainly did when I was starting out. So I'll tell you a few things to look for, in particular when your favorite company reports their earnings so you don't feel too overwhelmed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eThe first thing I want you to look for is something called net debt. If the company had to pay back all of their debt to their lenders tomorrow with cash, could they do it right now Oh, that is net debt. Another ratio that I like to look for is something called the current ratio, which is essentially, it takes a company's total assets and compares it to their total liabilities, right? So do they have more assets than they have liabilities? And if they do, that's usually a good thing, right? So net debt, if they had to pay back all their debt tomorrow with cash, could they do it, and then that current ratio, assets versus liabilities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e So now the income statement. So now we're going to the income statement here, this is probably the most important financial statement of the bunch, at least I think. So This financial statement tells you how much revenue and profit a company made during the quarter, as well as their margins, their expenses, and other key financial insights that you will need when evaluating a company in a business here. So here are a few key items, line items that I want you all to look into when you're reviewing and interpreting the income statement. Right. So we did this with the balance sheet. Now income statement, here's a couple of those line items. The first one here is revenue, right, which appears as maybe sales or net sales or as a couple of names, but it's just you know, how much money is coming into the business, right revenue, money made from selling products and services. Now, a good sign to observe with this line item, in particular, is that it's growing year over year. And usually you'll see a company include last year's same-period financials right up next to this periods to make it easier for you to compare and contrast the growth. So revenue, great ones to the growing. Next up is gross margin. This is a line item gross margin. This is how much actual profit the company's making by selling their product or service. This figure is usually distilled down and interpreted as a percentage. So just take that gross profit margin number then divided by the revenue and you'll get a percentage like, oh, yeah, I've got you know, 82% profit margins like that. That's kind of like what I'm kind of talking about here. Right? So they'll give you the raw gross margin number, but it's up to you then to see what is that percentage margin by comparing it then to that revenue figure. You'll also want to see this figure remain around the historical norms or grow, right, we don't want to see a company's gross profit margins declining, right? That's not a good sign. However, you do not want to see, right, this number decrease. We don't want to do that historical norms coming up, go up and down with seasonality, but never to really see it take a plummet like that. Right. So the last line item here on the income statement to look out for is the after tax profits. This is called net income. We obviously want after tax profits of the companies we're investing into to increase year over year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e So we have the balance. We have the balance sheet, we have the income statement. Now finally, let's talk about the cash flow statement. Right? This is my favorite because I believe cash is king, especially as it relates to running and growing a business. Now, this statement tells us about how much cash came into the business. Where that cash came from, did it come from selling products? Did it come from taking on a bunch of debt, right where the cash came from? So how much came in where it came from, as well as how much cash left the business? Right? So for me, I like to keep an eye on the cash flow from operations line item, it tells you how much money the business made by operating its business, right? So it's like, okay, for the last three months, right, because its quarterly earnings report, cash from operations, here's how much cash came into the business by operating our business pretty straightforward. You want to see this figure move up, year over year as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e So now let's round all of us off with the second idea here the earnings call right so we covered the financial statements, all the hard facts, but what about the conference call, where Wall Street analysts get a chance to ask questions. So alongside the financial statements, the CEO and other chief executives at a company will sit down and host something called an earnings call. During this conference call, they'll expand further upon their financial results provide guidance as to where they think their company is headed in the near term, as well as answered questions asked to them by analysts on Wall Street. Now, here's the important stuff to remember with these earnings calls to financial statements that the publicly traded companies shared with us are one thing, these are the hard numbers. But more importantly, it's only a snapshot of a specific moment in time for the company, right, the company's financial results for that quarter to snapshot in time a good picture. The earnings call, on the other hand, allows us the investor to get a more realistic and more importantly updated point of view on the company and where things might be headed. Right. So during this time, we're able to hear from their chief executives also about non-GAAP generally accepted accounting principles, operating metrics, like remaining performance obligations for SaaS companies, or perhaps a backlog of purchased equipment for manufacturing companies, or maybe even the executives best guess on what the economy might have in store for us given their first-party customer data. You'll see a lot of bank stocks give us kind of updates on the economy because they're seeing what people are spending their money on. It's important to tune into these earnings calls as investors not only to hear about the intricacies of the financial data shared but also how have the ability to learn more about the information that is not shared in those financial statements, right? The non-GAAP operating metrics, you know if it's the RPO’s or the SAS companies with backlogs are that other added color around the economy that these companies, these executives rather want to share with us. Also a little side quest here and this is what I like to do for fun. Again, nerd, if you want if you're more of a visual learner, right? Most of these companies actually create a investor presentation, a PowerPoint presentation, essentially, where they take their financial and operating results and turn them into beautiful graphs and images, and all that fun stuff. And you can usually find these investor presentations on their Investor Relations website. But don't be surprised if the company you're looking for doesn't offer presentation. Because again, it's not like required for them to make that it's only you know, for fun.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eSo yeah, there you go. I hope you enjoyed hanging out with me over the last kind of 12 to 15 minutes here for this episode of 15-minute fundamentals. If you want to hear more from me specifically, I have a newsletter.

Yasmine, welcome to Public Llive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks so much for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would love to jump right in Yasmine and learn more about what Engine No. 1 is focused on besides sounding like a fire station. But perhaps appropriate given the topic? Could you just walk our audience through what you do, who you all are and what it is that you guys are focused on?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely. And in fact, you are right on the fire station piece. So\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003epretty good image. But absolutely. So number one is an investment firm that is focused on identifying and investing around what we believe are large scale transformational investment themes. We're a firm founded by former hedge fund and private market investors and have a background in deep fundamental analysis. We launched a little over two years ago, and I think are probably best known for our activist campaign in which we successfully placed three people on the board of directors at ExxonMobil.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think, actually, the campaign was quite interesting, because it reflects, I think, two things that really sit across the entire firm, really pillars of what we do. The first is that we were able to do that while only owning five basis points of the company. Well, the reason we were able to was because we focused all of our arguments and recommendations on why they were additive to long term shareholder value, which allowed I think other investors to vote alongside of us. And I think what it shows is, if you've grabbed your thinking in economics, you can accomplish quite a lot in the public markets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second that I think is kind of reflective of what we do is that we're an engagement focused company. And usually in the space of climate, the mantra is, if you don't like it, you don't own it. So most climate strategies don't own the largest emitting sectors, the largest emitting companies – we very much own and deeply engage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so just to sort of unpack that a little bit more, first of all, as an activist with less than five basis points of ownership to to effect that change, Yasmin, it really brings to life what you say by actively engaging.\u003c/span\u003eLet's talk a little bit more into the work that Engine No. 1 is doing specifically on the topic of energy transformation. It's a really buzzy topic, everyone's talking about it. I'm just back from Davos, Yasmin, where climate and energy transformation was just a huge focus area. Help us cut through the jargon. What does energy transformation really mean, in your context?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, absolutely. So there are a number of reasons why we see a significant move towards decarbonization across our energy systems. Now, with that said, I think it's really important to note that we, as many other people believe that we continue to have a real near term need for fossil fuels. So that's really the transformation we're talking about. It's not a light switch. And I'd also say a lot of people talk about this as the energy transition. And there's so many terms that goes around. To us, that sort of implies a one to one move from traditional fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. But this is much more about truly a transformation of our entire energy system, and will take decades to play out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you did mention it's an enormous investment opportunity. By some estimates, it will require somewhere between $3-5 trillion of investment per year to meet Net Zero targets. So the opportunity creates a lot of investment opportunities, in fact, and they're not just in one sector, when people traditionally think about the energy sector. They really do span our entire economy. I will say I think the opportunity in my opinion is a little misunderstood. I think as I mentioned, the traditional thinking and climate is if you don't like it, you don't own it. So what does that really mean?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMost people tackling climate from an investment perspective, almost definitively have no exposure to traditional oil and gas companies, for example, are basically not exposed at all to the largest sources and uses of energy. We flip the entire conversation of this theme on its head. But just as a set stat to give this to life to people, nearly 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions just come from three segments of our economy, energy, agriculture and transportation, that is the heart of the energy transition. And in our opinion, to drive that sort of decarbonisation at scale, you really need to go where the emissions are. And I think it's the transformation of these various systems that we'll see both, you know, a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions, but also huge investment opportunities for people looking to take advantage of some of the dollars that are being put to work in these spaces.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to really drill into that, Yasmine, to make sure that there's no ambiguity here. So the ETF that you have, together at Engine No. 1 one does or does not include the stocks of what we people might think of as the more traditional carbon focused energy production companies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, we absolutely do our energy\u0026nbsp; transition focus strategy. Net Z absolutely has exposure to the companies that we believe are leading and benefiting from the transformation, which include companies exactly in those segments. I mean, if you think about it, if three-quarters of emissions are coming from the systems themselves, the leaders and incumbents as well as the enablers within these systems will be the companies that actually should benefit most from it. And so we do actually own traditional oil and gas companies, we own auto companies, we own agriculture companies. Now with all that said, these are the companies that are making the investments and have the I'd call it a short, medium and long term strategies to think about how they win in a world with lower carbon emissions. So they're absolutely focusing on the theme. But I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about where the opportunity lies from a company perspective.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat's a really interesting clarifying point, Yasmine, because I do think that there is this bias or this general perception that when you see instruments out there focused on energy transformation, they tend to exclude some of those traditional players. And just, you know, as an observation that we've seen, you know, in our discussions on public life, a lot of these energy, traditional energy stocks have done quite well, performance wise recently. So it's so interesting that you guys are not shying away from those rather, instead, including those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou've been very enthusiastic and emphatic about the fact that energy transformation, as you've defined it, is positioned to be an impactful opportunity and it's going to touch a myriad of industries. You talked about the three largest, can you just unpack for us a little bit more? It was transportation, agriculture, and energy as the biggest pockets of opportunity. But within that, where are you seeing key trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely. So maybe I'll say two things up front. In order to best take advantage of this opportunity, I have two beliefs. One, I think this is absolutely the space for active investment. I think you need to manage your hunting for the best opportunities across this value chain. Secondly, I think you need to be thinking broadly about the opportunity beyond just one sector, you need to be looking at the largest producers and consumers of energy and thinking about how these systems evolve. So maybe two examples to bring that to life. Transportation is a huge source of emissions. Now, most investors when they think about the opportunity and transfer, transportation are really thinking about the move to electric vehicles, and are solely focused on the automakers as they make a push to electrify their car fleet. Now, that is absolutely part of the opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, the real broader investment opportunity is much, much wider than that. You also need to think about the elements that are required to accomplish that electrification. So with that broader view, you would be looking at spaces like the metals and inputs that are required to produce batteries such as Lithium, for example. You would be thinking about the companies that are required to extract those metal metals, like mining equipment companies. You would also be thinking about the transportation of those inputs to battery plants, so you know what companies would benefit from this change in transportation. And I think the broader framing is much wider in that we play across that ecosystem and are sort of looking on a short, medium and long term basis for where we think the best opportunities lie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area maybe to highlight would be in agriculture. I think one of the interesting areas within agriculture is just precision agriculture. This is really about giving technology to farmers to be more precise and efficient in their usage of fertilizer and other chemical inputs in the farming process, which is one of the largest sources of emissions and farming. So the companies that are leading in this space are not only helping to reduce emissions by increasing efficiency and how we use these chemicals, but they're also saving farmers and therefore their customers on input costs. So this is a really interesting example of almost what you think of as a win win win. It's good for the company playing in this space, because it should lead to increased market share. It's good for farmers, and it's obviously good for the environment if we're being more precise and how we use these inputs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk Yasmine, a little bit too, about the engagement work and sort of go full circle, you know, you opened with what you've done in effectuating change at ExxonMobile., What is your approach to working with companies? What's your process? What's your ideation process to then how you engage with the company to then how you affect change?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it really comes down to taking all of this with an investment foot view. So we're an engagement focus firm. What does that mean? That means in our opinion, whether you own one share, or you own an entire company, you're an owner. Now, most engagement that happens in the asset management community, in my opinion, is really coming from the perspective of quantity, talking to as many companies as possible about as many issue areas.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you see that, for example, and a lot of stewardship reports that come out at the end of the year from asset managers who say, you know, we talked to 25% more companies this year, therefore, we had more engagement. We take a very different approach, we go very deep and very focused, and we're working directly with the companies that we think are really impactful in the spaces that we operate in. So for example, in the energy transition space, what meets the bar for engagement? Well, first, it's deep fundamental work. We're trying to understand where some of these areas around decarbonization link to an unlocking of value. And secondly, it's about, you know, really working closely with the C suite of many of these companies to help them think about affecting their strategy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think the goals can be really wide ranging on one end, it's simply accountability. You know, these are hard strategies to execute for public companies that are focused on quarterly earnings, where these are much longer term strategies in nature. But there's also an acceleration component. Many of the parts of this transition really involve impediments and bottlenecks to the strategic plan. So we sit across the entire ecosystem, and I think can offer some valuable perspective on how best to achieve these long term goals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen there's transformation, you know, companies that are not on the right path, we think, to maximize shareholder value in a world that's decarbonizing and so there's, there's really opportunities there, too, that maybe worth highlighting to bring it to life. Maybe just to play on some of the spaces we talked about. We've actually been working really closely with a number of the executives at large automakers as they think about how to reach their EV goals, given the challenges around creating batteries. And so helping them think through how to source the input parts and how to sort of think about their overall approach to battery plants, and then how to execute on the long term goal of electrifying their fleet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second was really building upon what we've done in oil and gas, which is we've worked with several large oil and gas companies on helping them to measure and ultimately reduce their methane emissions. Most people don't know this, but methane is something like 80 times more potent than CO2, and so has a really meaningful impact when you reduce it. But in all of these cases, since our Exxon engagement, they have all been very collaborative. I think many management companies really welcome the engagement and I think really appreciate the approach we take, which is really focused on how to think about this from a shareholder value lens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYasmine, this is a question coming a little out of left field, but it really is on this topic of engagement and how retail investors can do that. You know, I go to my mailbox, and I often you know, I get shareholder vote, correspondence where I hold stocks, what can the average retail investor do? And to your point who doesn't have the kind of huge holdings where you typically see more engagement? What can they do to have their voice heard with these kinds of companies?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I love this question, because to me, this is one of the most interesting trends happening in investment management. The reality is that our whole public market system is centered around the shareholder. Now, as an individual investor, you own a very small piece, but actually, collectively, individual investors own a tremendous amount of the public markets. In fact, the three largest passive firms in the world own about 20 to 25% of the average S\u0026amp;P 500 company, and who are their beneficial holders? Well as individual investors, in many cases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat I think the first thing to do is actually understand the system altogether, there's 10s of 1000s of votes that come up that public companies, and I'd say about 500 of them are actually focused in areas around the environment, social issues, governance issues, issues that may be really important to you as an investor. And I think it's really first and foremost understanding that. Secondarily, it's understanding how your manager’s voting, you know, you get to pick and choose where you put your money. And I think now there's certainly more choice in the space around managers who may have a\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003edifferent approach to how they support or not support certain proposals that come up for vote at companies. These are happening every year - so I do think a little bit more of knowledge is power. And I think this is actually going to be a really important trend for the next coming years, as retail investors understand that they actually collectively do own a lot of the largest companies in America.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's exciting, it's exciting to hear that there's a way to do these things. And then just last question Yasmine, which is, you know, supply chain strategy. We saw so much disruption, I know, that's something that you had Engine No. 1, have filed as a thematic to do something so just closing thoughts and a little more about that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, we're very excited about this one. This also fits into the bucket of the types of themes we invest in, which are really all about themes that are, you know, long duration and nature, large scale and their size, and I think maybe not perfectly are really understood by the markets. If you think about supply chains, where we're going really has to do with where we've been, which is for the last, you know, let's call it 40 years, companies have been really focused almost exclusively on one thing in their supply chains, which is minimizing cost. And as a result of that, they've moved large portions of their supply chain overseas to lower cost regions, and in many cases, you know, eliminated redundancies and supply chains.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow, what has this done, this has made supply chains more fragile, it's meant that companies are unable to meet supply spikes, and to really be responsive to demand in fact. And so what are we seeing, we're seeing a huge move to re-localizations of supply chains, which has wide reaching implications. This will have investment implications across spaces like manufacturing, automation and innovation, as we think about some of the types of things that are coming back to the U.S. and places like transportation as we think about disrupting how we move goods. And also probably means more jobs in the U.S, so this is a theme we're very excited about. It's actually in our opinion, linked very closely to the idea of the energy transformation, they sort of go hand in hand and this is another kind of example of where we see a pretty pretty big investment opportunity that lies in front of us. In fact, just to put some numbers on it for folks, during COVID companies lost something like $3.5 trillion dollars because of their supply chain disruptions, so this is a conversation truly about economics.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat conversation that was, Yasmine - just incredible to have you on.

I'm your host Nora Ali. And today, we are talking about goal setting and, more specifically, how the types of goals you have might shape your investing strategy. With us today to discuss all of that is Taylor Sohns, a Co-founder of LifeGoal Investments. life goal is an ETF issuer focused on helping everyday Americans reach their financial goals with funds like the H O M ETF, which is focused on showing investors what dollars they have allocated for a downpayment on a future home purchase. Taylor, welcome. Thanks so much for having me, Nora. I am super excited to be here. Awesome. Great. We love the enthusiasm. So Taylor, let's start with two common types of goals that might ladder into different investment strategies, and that is retirement and non-retirement. First of all, how and why are these strategies and risk tolerance? Is tolerance is different for these types of goals?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a great question. And I am going to start off by saying that I am young. I am a 34-year-old millennial, just to give context to listeners, I'm probably in the same seat that a lot of them are in. So, Nora, great question. Right out of the gates, there are two vastly different buckets that need to be separated mentally and physically, if you will, between the retirement bucket and the non-retirement bucket. And so it's funny, I spend some time on social media as a millennial. And the echo chamber that you hear is the following quote by Warren Buffett. So Buffett says, quote, unquote, \"the best thing to do is buy 90% in an S\u0026amp;P 500 Index Fund,\" period. And then that goes away. And what they don't say what they fail to mention is that later in the conversation, Buffett also states \"if you're not willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes.\" And so that is the investing quote in its entirety. And people look at just the front end of this. And so Warren Buffett would never ever, ever tell someone with short or intermediate-term assets that are not in retirement plans to go out and roll the dice than the s\u0026amp;p 500. That is absolutely laughable and something that he would never do. So at the end of the day, what we always talk to people about is literally setting up two different strategies. One is your retirement account. And that's likely set aside with your employer, whether it's a 401K, a 403B, 457, whatever it may be, and then you have your brokerage assets on the other side. And what we talk about, people is literally write down, I don't mean that mentally writing down, I mean physically writing down your plan for both of these two different buckets. So I'll give an example of what I have written down literally right in front of me about my brokerage account. And then I'll tell you differently what I have written down as my plan for my retirement bucket. So my brokerage account is in this is written, and I go back to this often. So this says, my brokerage account dollars are there to outpace inflation; anything additional is a bonus, and I will remain diversified and actively tweak the allocation to take advantage of market opportunities, with the emphasis always being on preserving my money. This account is for singles and maybe an occasional double, but never a strikeout. And that's very, very important. Because in a brokerage account, that are assets that will be used in your everyday life, whether it be two or three years out, you're buying a car, a home, your kids going to school braces, whatever it may be, you can't afford to take on all the risks that you can in your retirement bucket. So conversely, this is what I have written down for the thesis on my retirement account. I'm invested for the long term; I'm willing to take on more risk. Because my time horizon is longer. I will remain diversified but tend to be more aggressive without trying to hit home runs. No strikeouts here, either. And so that's how I think about things. Again, you have two totally different time horizons. And when you're investing, time horizon is the absolute emphasis on what determines how you allocate those assets. Shorter term means more conservative, and less aggressive, longer term means you're able to be more aggressive, but only if you're able to stomach the ups and downs in the market, which is a very important point as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's great. I like the idea of writing down your goals because then it just reminds you of the purpose of each of, your buckets. You mentioned time horizons. Can you give us a little bit more detail as to how you go about figuring out what your time horizons are for your different buckets and your approach to that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's super important. Obviously, you need to know what your money is set aside for. And so, just like writing down a mission statement for the actual investments, before that, you need to sit down and write down what your goals are, again, your retirement assets are set aside; you're not touching those till you're 65 years old. And that's why your shorter-term investments are really important to understand what it is that you're investing for. So at the end of the day, you may have an emergency bucket, and you should have an emergency bucket. And that's called xix, nine months set aside in cash or cash, like security stuff, that's not going to bounce around in case you lose your job, in case you decide to step away from your role and start a new company like I did, whatever it may be, but after that, then you need to think, Okay, I have access income, and therefore I have money to put in a brokerage account. What are the intentions of those assets? What's happening in my life that may dictate where those dollars go? And the advice on our end is always to err on the side of caution. Right. I didn't necessarily think that five years ago that I was going to launch LifeGoal Investments. But I had a very good job that made a very good income. I worked at Wall Street. And at one point, I said, \"Okay, enough is enough of this. I want to go out and try to build a company to help the masses as opposed to the mass affluent that I was working with in the past.\" And my paycheck went to zero. That wasn't anticipated. And I'm very, very glad that I erred on the side of caution, focused more on the short term, focused more on, hey, I don't necessarily know what's to come in my future. And with that, I'm going to remain more conservative, as opposed to remaining more aggressive. And in 2022, obviously, this has come home to roost in spades. It doesn't matter what you've been invested in. Now granted, the more aggressive the worship, then but even the modest bond exposure that people have that think about, you know, sleepy, old, boring old bonds have sold off some as well. So if you're investing, you need to know what your goal is, what you're going to do with that money, or what the unknown for that money might also be. And then, you go about writing your mission statement as to how you're investing that money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eWe hear that term diversification a lot when it comes to investing. So from your perspective, Taylor, what are the core tenets of diversification that investors should be wary of specifically when they're thinking about goal setting?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, diversification can be a laughable topic. Because people look at diversification, they say, Hey, I own three different ETFs, I'm diversified, and that the two most popular on social media that I see talked about all the time, and nothing against these, but I'll tell you why you don't want to own them in the way people own them. So Vanguard is vastly popular on social media. So you look at Vanguard's S\u0026amp;P 500 V O., and then people say I'm diversified, I own VO, and I own VTI--Vanguard's total stock market index. What's funny about those two things is when you look at the correlation between them, and I'll discuss that in a second, they correlate at 99%, meaning they do the exact same thing at all times in the market. So the markets going up, they go up in unison. When it comes down. Unfortunately, they come down. And in essence, that is the antithesis. That is the opposite of what diversification really means. To understand diversification, you have to look at how things correlate together; how things correlate is a statistical analysis. And this isn't something you have to do on your own. Thankfully, we could all be, you know, in a terrible spot if we did. There are websites online where you can look at the correlation between different holdings. But essentially, what you want to do is you want to put together different assets, whether it be stocks, bonds, commodities like corn and oil, gold, and real estate, a combination of those things that have low correlations to each other. So let's look at stocks and bonds. Over time, stocks and bonds have a very low correlation. Call it somewhere between zero mean, they don't do anything the same 2.3%. And what that does, is in a strong market, where the economy is churning, and results in an really strong economic backdrop, your stocks are going to really do well. And your bonds might not do as well--they certainly aren't going to keep pace. That's not what they're meant to do inside of your portfolio. But in a year where we hit a recession, stocks are likely to sell off. And the low correlation with bonds proves to be essential. Bonds have a historical performance of doing very well during a recession. For context here, I'll give you some real numbers. Right, the last real recession we had, I'm not calling 2020 to the 45 or 2020 to 45 minutes session we had there as a recession. But look back in 2008 and 2008, it was a disastrous year for the market. We didn't even know if our economy was going to be able to hold up our banking system was gonna hold up. And with that the S\u0026amp;P 500 sold off 37%, down 37%. And at one point, it was down 49% throughout the year, that year, bonds returned 5.4%, which is above their long-term average. So obviously, that's when you want to have that yin and yang of stocks and bonds in your portfolio at the same time. Now, let's fast forward to this year. 2022 has been a really tough year. Inflation has driven almost all assets downward. So what do you do in that scenario? Well, a different leg of that stool has held up pretty darn well this year. So you've had stocks sell off at one point, they were down 25%, the S\u0026amp;P 500. The NASDAQ was down 35%, almost bonds have sold off as well. This is the worst year bonds have ever had. Bonds right now for the year are down about 12%. The worst year they've had in history going back to 1976, when the bond aggregate was put together, was down 3%. So this is almost a five time multiple of how bad bonds have ever been. But stocks and bonds haven't worked. What has worked is commodities. Commodities have worked in an inflationary environment, look at oil this year, it's been a very, very good asset to be in to hold up when stocks and bonds have sold off. So again, the basis and the crux of diversification comes down to how assets correlate with each other. And what you want to do is put together different assets inside your portfolio that have low correlation to each other going out and buying VTI. And VO is not diversification going out and buying Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon--is not diversification. They all go up and down on days together. And that is not what you want to do. When you look at an overall diversified portfolio. You want to put together the pieces on the outside that have that low correlating asset to them to have something holding up inside of your portfolio at all times. How do you go about phasing out the allocation of these different asset classes? It totally makes sense and diversifying across bonds, equities, and commodities, but how do you determine the right balance? Or, I guess, how do you start figuring that out? So so that's where it gets tough. Right? So that's where it goes back to the original conversation, what are we investing for? Is this the retirement assets that we're investing for, and therefore, you're going to be disproportioned? If you're young, you're going to be disproportionately weighted towards stocks, which are the higher risk, higher rewarding asset over time, or are these your short and intermediate term assets, in which case bonds should be the bulk of the portfolio because they're more stable, again, the worst year they've had prior to this year, and their history over the last 50 years is down 3%. the predictability of bonds is what you're looking for over time. So at the end of the day, what you need to do is have your goals, understand what the money is built for, then understand the mission that you've written down and what your intention with the investment is, and then allocate accordingly. And if you're not able to allocate accordingly, because maybe you don't have the expertise, or the time or the interest, which is, you know, there's a lot of smart people out there that are way smarter than me that just don't have the interest in finance, then you need to go out and find another solution. And so when you think about other solutions, what does that look like, doesn't look like rolling the dice on, again, a couple individual ETFs, that you don't know how they correlate together, because they've all gotten smoked this year. But, you know, selfish plug here, you look at what we do at LifeGoal Investments, my background, and the company's background was working at Wall Street. So we would go around and work with ultra-high net worth people that have sometimes $50 million to invest and put together a portfolio for them. What we did when we decided to get away from that and start life goal investments was sent to ourselves, what does the person that makes $50,000 a year, whatever the number is, that has $5,000 to invest, and want to invest it for a three 510 year timeframe. What do they do, that don't have the interest in going out and plugging together all these pieces for them? And this came from the catalyst for all this. The genesis was people coming to us, our friends, and saying, Hey, I have seven grand to invest, what should I do? And we're like, Well, what do you want to do with it? I might use overthe next five years. Okay, question mark, then what do you do? And so what we did was takeall of that sophisticated portfolio composition that we did for the ultra-rich, and we justpackaged it inside of one ETF. It's called a multi-asset ETF. Each of our ETFs have stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate embedded within them, instead of one single ticker symbol. You can buy it for $10 a share on any platform like Public.com. And so that's what we've done. And we've said, hey, we understand people don't have the interest the time or the education potentially to do this. Let's give it to them inside of one package that they can access easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk about losing. You know, because we've all done that this year, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eCan you walk us through some of the math that goes into breaking even after you've experienced a setback?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. So let's start mid-extreme right. So 2008, the market had pulled back the S\u0026amp;P 500 year had pulled back 49% at the depth of the drawdown. And not coincidentally, by any stretch of the imagination, when it pulled back 49%, you also had the highest level of selling that the s\u0026amp;p 500 has ever experienced. And so that's human nature, right? So human nature is Darwinian, whatever you want to call it, is fight or flight; we can't fight the stock market. So it's flight. So when people get scared, they say, I'm out. Right? And actually, when you look at consumer confidence, and I'm getting away from your question, I will get back to in a second, when you, when you look at consumer confidence, which right now is that the depth, which has a ton of pessimism, consumer confidence is actually an inverse indicator, when consumer confidence is really high, the subsequent 12 month period average, is a 4% return, when consumer confidence is really low, which is right now, the next 12 months average is a 25% return. So there have been eight points since consumer confidence has been tracked that have been as low as we're at right now; the average next 12-month return is 25%. With the worst performance over that 12-month period, being 14% return, I think any one of us raise our hand, say I'll take 40%. But again, going back to the original part of the conversation, you don't want to lose money. So when you look at 2008, the stock market pulled back 49%. We'll call it 50%. To round to get back to even when you lose 50%. It's not 50%. So let's do the math allowed here; you have $10 a start, it draws down to $5, a 50% loss, you need to double that 100% return to get back to $10. So the key to growing wealth over time is not hitting home runs because home runs come around with strikeouts as well. And that's losing money. The key to making money over time is consistently hitting singles and doubles. You can't afford that big drawdown. Because even if you are willing to sit in the seat through that big drawdown, and be down 50% and say, hey, I'll stick with it, you got to get 100% back to get you back to that breakeven mark. Whereas let's look at a different number. If you draw down 10% Well, that's not good either. But a 10% return, you need an 11% Return to get back to breakeven. So again, the bigger the drawdown, the bigger multiplier effect it is to get you back to even so again; at the end of the day, when it comes to investing, you win by not losing over time. And when you win by not losing, that comes back to that portfolio composition. You can't have all your eggs in one basket; you need to be diversified. So your overall portfolio isn't selling off at the same time, like an allocation sided with VTI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eVery helpful context to close us out, Taylor. Can you walk us through some other goals-based investing strategies for our audience and examples you can share that have helped investors stay focused versus saying, oh, I just want to have X number of dollars in the future?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's really tough. If you asked most people, you know, XYZ, Mr. Mrs. Smith, that are together that are 30 years old. You just got married, and you put your money together in an account; how much money do you have set aside for your impending house purchase? Whatever it is, and they look at their account, and they go, Well, I see I have $25,000 in cash in our bank account. But we also need a car, and we're going to get a dog, and whatever it is, you don't have that money earmarked. Right. And that's something that's really important for you to do. So there are a couple of different ways that you can do this. You can set money aside in different bank accounts, which is a hassle, but that's also what some people do to say, hey, this money is specifically in this account because this is my car payment. And this money is in this account because this is my, you know, impending home down payment dollars. And that's exactly what we did. We launched our life go home downpayment product. We said, Hey, we know that people put their money not only in a checking account but also into a brokerage account like publix.com, and they have holdings there, and again if it's just four different ETFs that have different ticker symbols VTI, I keep picking on them for whatever reason, or is any of that money earmarked for something specific? No. So one of the reasons that we named our one ETF the home downpayment with a ticker $HOM is the psychological component to it. Someone looks at it and immediately goes, hmm, okay, I have $16,000 there. That's exactly how much money I have set aside for that home downpayment that is coming up when we find that right house over time, and along the way, that's invested conservatively to help you attempt to grind out returns to allow that 16,000 to come 16,005 on earn 17,000. And that's the intention of the product over time is to be that conservative, slow-mo, type portfolio that gets you to your goal over time. But again, to your point, the fact is that it's very hard if your money is just piled together to dictate what is meant for this purpose in this person, this purpose, and this one and that's a lot of the naming convention that went along with our home downpayment product, to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eAwesome, a lot of great insight today.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture and investing. I'm your host, Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Before we get into it, let's get the energy in the room up. Let's hit that like button. We've got a really exciting episode for you guys with some great guests. So let's get into that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we are joined by Dylan and Bradley from Altan insights, the leading platform for alternative asset investing, intelligence and analysis. Dylan and Bradley will be sharing some of the biggest findings from their latest research on the sports collectibles market covering both sports cards and memorabilia. Since we're going to be talking about so many current events and what's happening in these markets, at the moment through the report, and there's a lot to get through, we're going to skip the five and five and jump directly into it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo without further ado, let me hand it over to the guests. Dylan, Bradley, could you quickly reintroduce yourself to the audience? I know you've come on Public live a few times. Introduce yourself and Altan insights. Give us a bit of an overview of the new report that you've just released about sports collectibles in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. Thanks, Calum and thanks for having us back. My name is Dylan Dittrich, and I kind of lead the research effort at Altan Insights. And what Altan really focuses on is kind of empowering and arming the modern investor to explore alternative asset classes. Specifically, we look at collectible asset classes, things like fine art, wine, sports collectibles, classic cars. And so providing research analysis and data to kind of dig deeper into those asset classes, understand how they perform and understand the different kinds of forces that drive them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so as part of that effort on a quarterly basis, we put out a report on the state of the sports collectibles market, how sports cards are performing, how sports memorabilia is performing, you know, what are the different trends in different sports? How are collectors and investors approaching these categories? So I certainly would encourage everybody to visit the site and download the report if you're interested and have the time - but it was certainly an interesting second quarter to chronicle. Much like other assets that can be more speculative in nature, sports collectibles were challenged in some pockets, but had some really kind of interesting and even encouraging things happening in others. So looking forward to kind of diving into those with you guys today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd I'll just second Dylan. Thank you for having me on. I'm with Altan Insights as well. I do research alongside Dylan. I worked on the sports collectibles report that we put out recently in the first and second quarters as well as our art report and I’m also a qualified appraiser with the International Society of appraisers covering art, collectibles and memorabilia. So I've always had a big interest in the valuations of these assets, following them as actual investable vehicles and just tracking the data and the performance records everything that you can see in our reports on a quarterly basis, and you know, just putting out the research that we do looking at the sales and kind of going beyond just the numbers, so thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, great. Thank you both for the introduction. I want to get straight into the report. So like, what have we learned about the sports collectibles market in Q2? And I want to take kind of one of the big points that you made in that report, which was, are we seeing a healthy reset of the market away from speculation, or has a paradigm shift occurred that will change the way these markets perform going forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think just to zoom out a little bit, like some other categories of when, when the pandemic hit, kind of fueled by nostalgia fueled by stimulus checks, fueled by more time at home, sports collectibles really started to soar. So sports cards in particular, as people kind of, you know, revisited old treasures that might have been in the basement or the attic, and kind of revisited hobbies from their past. And it just brought a huge new audience into this space. And with that new demand came, you know, very rapid appreciation in these categories. And, as was the case, in other categories that saw similarly heightened demand over the last few years, the second quarter of 2022, was was challenging, as people became kind of skittish about the state of the economy, skittish about, you know, traditional financial markets, they were relatively eager and willing to sell these assets. And in many cases, that led to, you know, significant kind of declines in value across many different categories within the sports collectible space. And so I think a part of that is, is very likely a healthy reset of perhaps some things that had run a little bit too high, too fast.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think it's also important to add the caveat that, you know, it seems kind of indisputable that since before the last few years, the audience has definitely grown for the long term. And so, you know, we'd still expect to see there, you know, be more interested in this space than there was previously. But you know, when there's economic economic turmoil, when there's traditional financial market turmoil, it's not uncommon to see speculative assets like these sell off, even though that hasn't necessarily always been the case in sports collectibles. You know, historically, in other moments of financial crisis, economic crisis 2008, 2009, for example, you know, there are indices that suggest that sports cards didn't sell off that much. But, you know, we live in a very different kind of market today where people can basically sell cards that at a moment's notice, you know, friction is much lower than it has been in the past. And so when kind of investor and collector sentiment turns, you know, people can act on that, and so very easily nowadays and, and I think that played a role in sending some valuations lower in q2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eBradley, did you want to jump in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eI second Dylan on that. And also say that while we saw those pullbacks within the broader market, and I'm sure we'll touch on the upper end of the market, it continued to hold up well, which is something we haven't seen tested over the last few years, right. These are markets that have been tracked in some cases for decades now, and to see the broader market pull back rather significantly, and in some cases, well beyond even just a traditional stock market or other asset classes, but then to also simultaneously see the highest end of the card market your your blue chip type cards and memorabilia, seeing record prices, and in some cases, the auctions seeing heightened volume, more bidders, an increase in bids on high end cards definitely showed just a shift almost, when you look at a traditional market, that movement from maybe growth to value that you see sometimes in downturns. So it's certainly some things that we see across other markets are being replicated in sports collectibles as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. And just as a point for both of you, definitely feel free to just jump in whenever you want. We want to be as much of a conversation as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think you both made some great points. Dylan, I wanted to pick up on one thing you mentioned, which is the sports card market today, there's a lot less friction when it comes to access to liquidity. Could you go a bit deeper into that like, versus what we've seen historically, what are some of the factors that have caused there to be a lot less friction in the market, it's a lot easier for people to, like exit their position. Is that auctions? Is that the fractional markets? What are some of those factors that have caused that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think when you think about all of this new demand that's come into the space, you know, with that comes investment dollars and the pursuit of innovation, to make things, you know, easier on that new demand to make it easier for them to transact. And so I think a lot of the leading platforms in the space, whether you're talking about auction houses, whether you're talking about marketplaces, the technology that they're using has advanced considerably. The marketing around auctions has increased considerably, the frequency of auctions has increased considerably. And there's also a lot of, you know, competition to be the venue where people are buying and selling sports collectibles, and so that has the power to lower costs as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so, whereas, you know, in decades prior, somebody might move to sell a card, and they might have to wait, you know, a month or two for the next auction, or they had to, you know, create their own eBay listing and kind of wait for that to be completed, it's really a lot easier today and it takes a lot less kind of manual legwork. And there are many platforms, you know, kind of designed to make buying and selling these things akin to buying and selling stocks. And we see that with fractional platforms as well. And so there's definitely an increased focus on liquidity, which is great, that means you can convert your asset to cash in a shorter amount of time and with greater ease. But on the flip side of that, that means that, you know, a market and valuations and price levels can react a whole lot faster when people start getting a bit nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think it's such an interesting point that like the reduction in friction, means that from a psychological point of view, investors in sports cards can now act a lot more similar to how, you know, investors in more traditional assets, like stocks can behave.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I think, you know, to use an example from a more traditional asset class, you know, you know, the performance of asset classes, like private equity and private real estate, are always touted as being quite strong on a risk adjusted basis. But part of that is because the, you know, the valuations are kind of marked to market, aren’t updated with as greater frequency as public markets. And these, you know, private investment firms aren't buying and selling with as much frequency as actors and traditional public markets. So in a way that kind of smooths over those, those rough economic and financial patches, it's not to say that their performance isn't strong, but there's there is kind of an element of the way that it's measured, you know, kind of making things look a little bit stronger on paper sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, that's a really interesting point. I want to get a bit deeper into the data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Bradley, maybe we can check to you for this one. I know one of the things that you mentioned in the report, was that you use the PWCC indices to kind of understand the market and what's happening. Can you quickly just explain to our audience, first of all, why is the PWCC indices so important for that? And then also, what are some of the limitations of using those indexes to look at the market today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. So PWCC they’re a marketplace and auction house and they have multiple indices, they have five ranging from the PWCC, 100 500, and then 2500. And their indices track a range of cards, but they are primarily vintage based. So you mentioned, like some of the shortfalls of those indices, one of them is that they do primarily track vintage cards, so cards dating really pre 1980s. And so PWCC, they really have the longest tenure as a performance tracking metric, they date back to the early…actually to 2008 is when the PWCC indices start. So you kind of get that tail and in the 2009 timeframe of the financial crisis. So you have one of the reasons why I believe that they're used so frequently is not only because they date back, but more importantly, because they date back to a very specific moment in financial markets history. And they, if you look at the indices, they do change in terms of their composition, but they primarily revolve around your blue chip Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth cards, whether they're rookies or just pre-war, or close to post-war cards, and those cards while they've performed very well, it's not always the greatest representation of the overall market. As I had discussed previously about how the broader market struggled but the blue chip higher end market performed very well, we just saw that happen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if you're looking at, you know, the last six to nine months, you might see a lot of cards across the board. And a lot of cars, maybe people on here owned, have maybe dropped in value. But meanwhile, we're seeing some record sales for Honus Wagner or Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth, or whoever that player might be in their rookie cards or in some of their early cards, that maybe is not the greatest representation of the overall market. So that's the one challenge, it is used just because we need some way of tracking an industry that has a composition of multiple cards across a span of time. But as with any industry, it might not be the best representation of the overall market and also of the sale frequency. So it's not necessarily looking at in a downturn market, is the volume still the same? Are people still selling their cards in that period of time? Are people still buying those cards in that period of time? Is the market still as active? There's a lot of metrics that maybe aren't incorporated in some of those indices, which do create the shortfalls, but are still important to include in any research and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eI think it's such an interesting distinction, definitely when I started to learn more about sports cards, the distinction between like the vintage older cards, and then the more modern sports card, and perhaps you can both touch on this. Why do vintage markets perform so differently than like, more modern sports cards? Is it purely just about scarcity and supply? Or are there other factors that we can look at?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so this is, this was definitely one of the more interesting kind of tidbits to come out of our Q2 analysis. If you looked at second quarter performance of vintage and prewar cards, they were effectively flat down very, very slightly 1 to 2% versus modern and ultra modern cards, which were down in the neighborhood of 15 to 20%. And I think part of that is, you know, modern and ultra modern tend to be a bit more speculative in nature, you have speculation on players that are currently active younger players, people who have more of their career left in some areas, particularly in the ultra modern space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd when you look at vintage, there's a very long tenured collector base, the scarcity is naturally very low, just just by nature of the fact that these cards have been around for decades and decades. You know, over time, some have been lost, they've been damaged, so supply is very low. And I think, you know, many collectors aren't turning these cards over with as great a frequency - they're holding on to them. And that means less supplies available to the market, which of course can help keep, you know, prices kind of higher as demand grows, or even stays the same. And that's where you find a lot of quote unquote, blue chip cards that are very, very popular historically that are very well known, that are kind of like the top pieces of almost akin to fine art in this category. So a bit less speculation, less supply, and more longer tenured collectors and holders of these assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and then just to add, there's also been so many market shifts across you know, when these cards were initially coming out, think about some of the cards maybe you've seen breaking records like a T 206 Honus Wagner like these were really advertisements. They weren't built for card collectors. They weren't being produced in mass for you know..they were being produced and then slid into a pack of gum or candy or cigarettes, or they were being stuck at tables at diners. They weren't being produced where then we saw that shift in the 70s, 80s, 90s, where then it rotated into what is known as the junk wax era where you had producers of cards, pumping out incredibly high quantities of cards. There's a ton out on the market, you don't really see a whole lot of 1990s players with high, high sales in their cards and today, the shift has really turned to grading where we’re seeing such an increase in cards being graded. People are sending them off to places like Beckett, PSA, SGC to be graded and a very high percentage of cards within populations are being graded. So it's just been a real overall shift in the market that has definitely aided I think vintage as standing out and standing alone from a period of time where people weren't collecting cards maybe for investment pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e Bradley can you kind of go –I think that's a really interesting point you brought up on the grading, right? Can you kind of go a bit deeper? What is the impact on the market overall of you know, you're getting more PSA 10s You're getting more BGS 9.5 or whatever, like, what is the impact on vintage versus modern?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. It’s an impact that I don't think is probably being discussed enough. We do cover it quite a bit. We have a partnership with a company called Gem Rate, who tracks the percentage and the number of cards graded by companies like I mentioned previously, PSA, Beckett,STC. And for example, just PSA alone, they're seeing record cards coming through and being graded in items altogether. You know, their Q2 numbers, and this past quarter were the highest they've ever had graded. I believe the past month was their highest month on record. So at this point, you know, they've had two months this year, believe it was March, and then now July that have been their two highest grading totals in company history, in terms of just number of items.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that impacts everything because a lot of these prices, especially in modern cards are dictated by the grade. So for example, PSA grades on a numeric scale one to 10. With as well as an authentic grade if the card is maybe in too poor of quality, to receive a number. But a PSA 10, which would be like a gem mint card, the highest tier, will historically sell for higher than a PSA nine of that same card, right? There may be a flaw in the nine that deducts that one point. The problem is that people today are pulling cards out of packs and sending them immediately to PSA, the card has a higher chance than receiving a 10. And in turn, that overall population is skyrocketing, right? We're seeing some players like in the NBA, Zion Williamson, John Moran, where they have super high numbers of - I mean talking 10s of 1000s of PSA 10 graded cards for some of their base cards right now. Where for example, with the vintage, you have to almost get to the 60s before you start seeing a lot of these cards, receiving tents and that just comes down to people weren't pulling them and sending them out\u0026nbsp;immediately from packs. So it definitely is having an impact. And I think long term, we're going to see a swell of cards that were graded, that received 10s. It's going to be very difficult to really ever find appreciation and an increase in value when you have a card that has 20,000+ grades, and then maybe 10 to 15% of that population is a PSA 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd if you think about it, Calum, if you're an owner of a great advantage card, the threat of the population have that card growing now and really making your card a lot less valuable just by nature of the supply growing is a lot lower relative to modern because you know these cards have been in circulation they've been unwrapped from packs decades ago, you know, every now and then yes, some some new population will find its way to the to the grading companies. But you know, the likelihood of that happening at scale is much lower than it is for modern and ultra modern cars, and that's why the kind of the risk return formula, so to speak, for vintage is a lot different than it is for modern and ultra modern cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think that's super interesting. I'm going to ask one more question on the card point before we shift over to game one memorabilia and memorabilia overall, which I know is a very different picture than the card market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think one thing that was interesting as I was going through the report is amongst all kind of the doom and gloom in the sports card market, there were some promising signs. The economist David RPA, modern hockey card record sale at Heritage last month, the upcoming heritage auction for the Mantle. Can you both just kind of comment on those two sales and what you think they might indicate about the market overall as we look forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean the Mantle sale - so for context, one of the very highest graded 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle cards is up for auction at Heritage auction later this month, the special card because basically what happened was, these cards weren't wildly popular. When they were released back in 1952. They sat on shelves, and it was time for basically the 1953 print run to start being sold and tops needed the warehouse space. So they basically dumped boxes, and boxes and boxes of these cards into the ocean. And Mickey Mantle is kind of one of the preeminent, you know, baseball, cultural icons, certainly baseball card icons. And so probably one of the four very best examples of this card is being auctioned later this month. It's already over $7 million at auction, there's, I think, a pretty strong expectation that it's going to end up at $10 million plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time there was a sale of..so that's an SGC 9.5 Mickey Mantle. Back in early 2021, there was a sale of a PSA nine mantle for $5.2 million. And, you know, the stats are pretty clear that afterwards, not only did the broader and kind of lower quality Mantle market absolutely soar higher, but you could make the argument that, you know, it led to, you know, significant appreciation in the broader card market as well. It's a really big deal when a sale that big makes a very wide range of mainstream news headlines, because that creates new demand. It gets people excited about the space again, and it tends to have pretty wide ranging impacts. Now granted, it does take a sale of $5 million or $10 million to generate that excitement, which is exceedingly rare, but it does happen and it'll be really interesting to see, you know, what happens in the wake of that sale next month, or later this month rather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd all along the Mantle card has always stood out from a baseball standpoint, similar to in hockey. We've had a seven figure sale of Wayne Gretzky, but we have also been tracking as you mentioned, the McDavid card. So modern hockey has similar to some of the other modern sports has lagged pretty significantly in terms of the overall market. So in the first quarter, golden oxygens sold a Sidney Crosby card. It was a gold precious metal gems and went for 100 in just under $165,000, which set a record for any modern hockey card. And then in this past quarter or the past quarter we've just had or past month, there was a 2015 Connor McDavid card, which is an autographed patch card. So it has a patch from a game worn jersey within it, and it's sold for $228,000. So that established a new modern hockey card price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd actually, this is very timely, because just this week, there was one of the other so there are three cards in the population for the Connor McDavid that are graded PSA 10, and another one just sold this week for just over $200,000. So heading into the second quarter, we had never had a sale for a modern hockey card go for more than $200,000 and now we've had one, you know, essentially in the past 30 days now we've had two cards, same card, same grade, but it was definitely a validating sale to see one sell via eBay for over $200,000. So definitely some momentum within that market. But again, it's really a couple names: Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby, Alexander Ovechkin. But beyond those three, hockey though, just continues to trail the field overall for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, very interesting. I'm conscious that we're nearly at time. Everyone can stay on if they're interested to hear more, because we're gonna go into the sports memorabilia market. And I think if Q1 was kind of, you know, there was a plunging in the sports card market. I think it was the exact reverse on the sports memorabilia side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould you, and I'll put this to both of you. Can you kind of just give us some context, data wise what we saw with sports memorabilia, and then also like, what is the significance like why did this happen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so on kind of the second part of that question first. So when the sports card market was was booming, you'd see, and Bradley just alluded to one of them, you would see these cards that have little patches from either a game worn or player player worn jersey, selling for, you know, hundreds of 1000s of dollars, which in many cases is more than a full game used jersey would actually sell for. And so I think for the last few years, people both outside of the space, especially but also inside the space, have kind of taken a step back and said like, that doesn't make any sense. Like why is this little patch that's, you know, encased in cardboard selling for more than an entire game use jersey. And I think, you know, the idea that that shouldn't necessarily be the case has started to take hold, and the second quarter we saw, really for the entirety of 2022, but really in the second quarter we saw game worn jersey sales make headlines, there was a Diego Maradona, game worn jersey from the famous Hand of God World Cup match sold for over $9 million. Sotheby’s Golden Age auctions sold a set of Tiger Woods clubs from when he won the tiger slam for over $5 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so we just saw a huge volume of sales that were kind of headline sales that were over six figures. So to put it in context, in the second quarter of 2022. There were 42 sales at auctions of game used memorabilia that crossed $100,000. A year ago in the second quarter, there were just 13. So you're talking about more than triple, you know, increase. And I think a lot of that is, you know, card collectors coming into this space and realizing that there's, you know, an opportunity to own some incredible artifacts that, you know, maybe stand out from kind of the traditional to their traditional kind of cardboard pursuits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we put out actually a thread today on Twitter, Altan Insights, where we covered some of these record breaking sales and sports memorabilia. And one of the big highlights is, you know, the record books have really been reconstructed this year. There's three of the five largest public sales ever that have occurred. In terms of sports memorabilia, just this year alone. Dylan mentioned the Maradonna and then also the Tiger Woods. Also the Muhammad Ali championship belt that's sold. So we're just seeing the shift of people going after these really high end really impressive items that have historic context around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it's really exciting to see this shift in this movement of money that's going after you look at even at the Heritage auction coming up that we mentioned, there's the Mickey Mantle card, and that's going to be the big headline grabber. But very likely we'll see a new record set for a baseball bat. There's a 1918,1920 circa Babe Ruth game used in sign that that right now is priced just under a million dollars. I wouldn't be surprised if it by the end of the auction is a multi million dollar bat. It's a really impressive piece that is one of the earliest bats on the market that we've ever seen. I know there's been a lot of collectors out there looking for Babe Ruth's first bat that he used. So that had hit the market back in the early 2000s and went for over a million dollars. It hasn't came back yet. But this bat is probably about the second best thing that we've ever seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the momentum is just continuing within the space. And also just announced yesterday, I believe Sotheby's is going to be selling a Michael Jordan jersey from the 1998 NBA Finals. And that jersey will likely establish not only a new record for any Michael Jordan, game use jersey, but actually any basketball jerseys. We would need to get up to about 4 million to do that. It has an estimate between 3 to 5 million, but with the momentum we're seeing in the prices for other athletes like Ali marathon Tiger Woods, probably seems fitting that Michael Jordan would fit in somewhere in that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNow that's pretty iconic. You know, one thing I wanted to follow up on when we talk about these really high sale prices, especially with sports memorabilia. I know one thing that comes into it is the photo matching element. Could you guys just speak briefly about - refresh the audience on what is photo matching, first of all? And then why has it become so important in the valuation of these assets?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, photo matching has become a critically important topic. I think it always, not always, but it has been important over the last few years, but its importance has only increased as you see these very high value auction items being sold, and therefore the stakes being raised. And essentially, for those that don't know, you know, if you talk about something like a Michael Jordan worn jersey, or you know, a Wayne Gretzky worn jersey from the Stanley Cup, you want to know, if you're paying millions of dollars for this item? How do I know that he wore it in this game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so what photo matching is to kind of simplify it is basically comparing the game worn Jersey in question to very high resolution photos taken during the game in question, to match up very kind of, in most cases, minute details to confirm that this is indeed the jersey that was worn by that player in that game. And it can be things as small as you know, different holes in the mesh different, you know, little pieces of stitching, and how they appear on the jersey and, and matching those elements to the Jersey that's being sold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, I think when these very large prices are being paid, authentication is so very critical for the credibility of the market, for the credibility of those selling the item. And then for the buying collector to you know, be reassured that the item they've spent money on was who was really as built. And so photo matching is one way that that's accomplished. And you're kind of hard pressed to see nowadays, items sell for very high values without being photo matched to, you know, a certain moment. Generally not the case for more vintage items, for obvious reasons that the high resolution photography that you need to really make a conclusive photo match wasn't available until really, really more recently, but definitely important for any kind of more modern piece of game worn material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd to follow up, we dove into some of the data behind that photo matching and just looking at so in Q2, out of the top 10 sales, eight of them were marketed as being photo matched. And so there's a few companies out there Resolution, My Gray, who photo match these items, and 18 of the top point five items sold memorabilia wise at auction in the second quarter, add some label or some nod to photo matching, and that compares to 60% of the top 10, the previous year, 12 out of the top 25. So a pretty big difference. It's been around as Dylan had mentioned, but at this point, especially as we start to see these modern assets and the memorabilia side, continue to develop in price, it's pretty much necessary outside of a certificate or a letter of authenticity from the league, or the player itself. You know, memorabilia has always been a little bit of a money market because a lot of these assets weren't supposed to ever make it to an auction house, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Tiger Woods clubs that Golden Age sold, there was a little dispute because Tiger Woods and his agent claimed to still have the clubs, because there's almost this idea that they're not supposed to ever leave the player and it's somebody's responsibility to grab that jersey after the game and keep it, or to secure the club so they never see an auction house. But it was the work of some experts in the space that looked at a bunch of attributes around the clubs between the grip to ball marks to photos, and then were able to provide an opinion a photo match that pretty clearly had an impact considering they sold for over $5 million and easily exceeded any previous golf clubs sold by about $5 million. So it's having an impact on these markets, no question about it. And I really think in the next few years, it's going to become...if it's anything that is photo-matchable so it's not vintage, but it's anything really 1970 on it's going to require some sort of photo matching being a given for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's really interesting, and to be honest, it's pretty incredible that some of these assets they can even match it using photographs and all these things. Before we close out, I wanted to talk about the Muhammad Ali belt. Huge sale, there $6.18 million. I think the initial estimate was to be around like a million dollars.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you talk about what was the level of photo matching that we saw there? What was some of the story behind that? Like, why did it exceed the estimate by such a large degree?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is actually one of those interesting and rare cases where there actually wasn't a photo match at hand. And really, what the kind of source of you know, credibility and authenticity here was the provenance so meaning what was kind of the line of ownership from, you know, when the belt was on Muhammad Ali to when it came to auction. So a little bit of background, I think it was last month, heritage sold the WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that Muhammad Ali earned for his win in the Rumble in the Jungle, and they sold it for just under $6.2 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis one came from the collection of Drew Bandini Brown, who was Ali's corner man. He kept a lot of artifacts, memorabilia from all of his career in a storage unit. Eventually, the contents of that storage unit were sold. But it's a case where you know you have pretty strong provenance. You know where that belt’s been, you feel fairly confident that this is a belt that was earned by Ali - it was worn by Ali.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it really led to a bidding war between two bidders who were seemingly unwilling to lose. Turns out the winner was Colts owner Jim Irsay, who has basically been building a museum quality collection of kind of American cultural artifacts that he's actually taken on tour. So it's like, it's one of my favorite kind of investing rules for you know, really blue chip alternative collectibles is like, would Jim Irsay buy this because time and time again, he invariably shows up as a winner of a lot of these auctions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, one of those rare cases where, you know, photo matching wasn't playing a significant role in the authenticity here. But sometimes at an auction, all it takes is two highly motivated bidders to drive a value to, you know, levels that people previously thought were unheard of. Especially interesting in this case, because there is another WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that actually trades fractionally. And, you know, now that the question becomes, you know, what's that one worth? So definitely an interesting, very interesting piece of memorabilia. Very interesting story, and, you know, another just massive result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eJust as a follow up, I actually spoke this week with a representative from Heritage who runs some of their consignment, and was talking to him at one point about that night when it's sold, and it was out of the blue for them. So we talked about where something like that comes from, he had actually gone to sleep, said he woke up at like 3am and stuff was like still going. And to see, you know, they, you know, some people that are going to be involved in the auction, for example, they set a million dollar estimate, they had word of mouth from some potential betters that those bidders weren't going to let it go for under a million. But that's all it takes is two bidders on some of these items.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the same could go for this Mantle card coming up at the end of the month, or the Jordan jersey in September that I mentioned previously, like, it just comes down to if you have some people who are willing to put out that kind of money. And now we're at a point where that table and that tier has been set, where now it used to be a million dollars was a big hurdle for an auction house to clear. If they could clear that million dollar, you know, everyone was clapping and it was a really respectable auction. And that meant that they had a really strong line of bidders where it's almost 5 million at this point where, you know, it's like you're expected to have bidders lined up that are willing to push these items higher and higher the levels that we just haven't seen up until this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, it's pretty incredible to be honest, when you look at some of the other asset markets for crypto, for stocks, and you see how bearish people are and kind of the the sentiment there that we still have some of these really high ticket sales and records being broken in some of the alternative asset markets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDylan and Bradley, It's been a pleasure to have you guys on the show again, you're always welcome. Thank you to the audience and everyone that listened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you, Calum.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture trend investing. I'm your host Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Today, we are joined by Gerard Starkey, sports memorabilia expert, and co-founder of SAAS. Over the last 20 years, Gerard has built one of the most valuable and complete Michael Jordan player exclusive game worn collections in the world, and has been featured in Highsnobiety and elsewhere, as one of the preeminent MJ collectors. Sports memorabilia is a really exciting alts category, and he'll be demystifying it for us today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we get to that, though, we're going to cover some of the biggest headlines happening in the world of alts in a section I like to call five and five, five headlines in five minutes. Let's get started. So first of all, Nike sold a virtual NFT sneaker designed by artists to Kashi American army for $134,000. The sneaker was one of 20,000 in Nike;s first release with artifact in April. Collectors are hoping the shoes will become part of games like fortnight and Grand Theft Auto Six, while others are interested in physical versions of the shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eeBay is launching its first ever NFT collection. Thirteen limited edition NFTs that feature 3D animations of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky making one of his signature moves. They plan to drop additional NFT collections throughout the year in partnership with web3 platform OneOf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world's largest bottle of whiskey was sold for $1.4 million by auction house, Lyon and Turnbull on May 25. The bottle stands at an incredible 5’11 and was given a Guinness world record for being the world's largest bottle of whiskey in September 2021. It contains enough to fill about 444 standard bottles, or enough to make 5,287 whiskey sours, which is pretty crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew York based real estate, investment and brokerage firm Acada listed a New York building as an NFT on OpenSea for 15,000 ETH, approximately $27 million. The NFT represents ownership of the building. However, the buyer still has to follow standard real estate procedure offline for the transaction to go through.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, a former OpenSea employee has been indicted in the first ever case of NFT insider trading. Thirty-one year old former Product Manager Nathaniel Chastain was responsible for selecting which NFTS would be displayed on OpenSea’s homepage. He would then use that information to buy those NFTs before they were featured, and then flip them for 2-5x profits after that. So that's our five and five for today. We're now going to switch over to speaking with our guest Gerard Starkey. Gerard, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to have you on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks for having me on. It's a pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I'm super excited for this one. So just to begin, can you give us a backstory? I think you have like the most valuable MJ game on collection out there. Can you kind of just give us an intro into how you got into collecting these items?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI think first just to correct slightly, at one point in time, I was definitely the most valuable Michael Jordan collector, but in the recent in recent years, some very, very large investors have come in and bought up, you know, millions of millions of dollars of items in a very short span of time. So I'm definitely up there in the top two or three guys, but I'm possibly not the most valuable at this stage. But I was at one point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, you're in the conversation for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm definitely up there. But I don't want to claim the crown without giving my peers and fellow collectors, you know, the same type of esteem all the way up at the top there. For me it started before value was even a concern because for me it started out of pure passion as a teenager. And as you said earlier on, I've been collecting for about 25+ years. And I didn't necessarily start in Michael Jordan stuff. Specifically like stuff he'd actually used. It actually started just in the kind of the regular kind of original Jordans that were available at the time and and gradually progressed through the various kind of categories of collecting whether it was like originals, hard to get rare samples, back to originals again, and then the original market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginal releases of the Jordan shoes where it was very hot in late 90s, early 2000s, like it was, it just increased massively. And I actually was given a pair of game-worn Jordans from an ESPN athlete, I can go into that story at some point, but I was given them by an ESPN, so a cameraman, who was French. And when, as soon as I held that asset, the asset that I previously owned at the time, but that I previously collected didn't mean as much to me, because I had this asset that, you know, represented this athlete. And at that point, I took the opportunity to sell all my originals, which I sold very quickly. And I basically plugged it all into actual game news items. And now that was not as easy to find, but I'm quite resourceful. I speak seven or eight languages.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I basically went into the market on a global scale and just bought everything I could. And this went on for about 1015 years before the real boom happened, and I did it quite silently, because that was just my strategy, not quite being quite a competitive person. And being well, I was based in London, most of that time. So all of my peers were in Asia and the States. So for me to get stuff, I have to really hustle and bustle and just just grab as much as I could. And yeah, to this day, I don't sell my own collection, I just vault stuff and enjoy it and have it on display at my home and rotate it and collect things. I still obviously enjoy collecting. But you know, it's much harder now because the caliber of items I want to collect it's large sums of money. And I have to be quite selective, to be honest. Because I can't compete with all the bigger players in the current market. However, I obviously have a number of assets that these guys want. So the only way for me to really get into some of the really big, multimillion dollar items is to trade out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat's my collecting career in a nutshell and now I've built up so much expertise in the space that you know, I dibble and dabble in helping the Jordan Brand, do marketing campaigns. I am an adviser to big collectors around the world, helping them build up their collections. I do storytelling in displays around the world with various clients and partners. And I've got my own authentication company SAAS where, just like Public's doing, my main goal is to educate so that people can understand the assets, appreciate the assets, and get a really good sense of the value of the assets, because I think that's quite important. I think that is going to be the key element of this particular space, and actually any collecting space is going to focus on in the next sort of three to five years. It's all going to be about really getting specific, really getting clear valuations of stocks. At the moment, I think things are still bouncing around. But we'll get into that as we go through the question. So that's me and my collection, career from start to end and looking forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, sweet as you were saying that I was like, Gerard is living the dream, like the dream of any NBA fan, Michael Jordan fan. He is living it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask you because I think this is really interesting, and also just to give people in the audience a bit more context. Can you talk us through some of like those highlight pieces, those assets that are currently in your collection? Maybe like two or three of your favorite ones? And then also take us through like, how did you even get it? Maybe you can give us like a quick story of an interesting acquisition story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, I think probably the asset that I own, the pair of shoes I own that people will most likely recognize, is that I own The Shot. So I own the Black Cement Jordan 4s that Michael Jordan wore when he hit the shot over Craig Ehlo of the Cavs. And that for me is definitely in terms of emotional value an asset that captures a really big turning point not just in Michael Jordan's career but in the whole basketball, NBA kind of history. It's, in my opinion, its top three, possibly top one or two moments ever. So that's definitely, in my opinion, the biggest asset that people will really appreciate, I think on a global scale without question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI own obscure pieces like the Nike Alpha Force that Michael Jordan wore in the same kind of period, as he was wearing Jordan, threes and fours and he was trying to, you know, get comfortable in the shoes. There's some talk about him, it being a transition point, as am I going to stick with Jordan, they're trying different midsole shoes models, and he actually started wearing Nike Alpha force, which isn't the Jordan shoe. But he wore them two or three times, and I have the pair that he played in against the Milwaukee Bucks. So that's a cool, very unique piece, not as big a celebrity as The Shot. But definitely for me, it's a piece that I appreciate a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then you're seeing other other shoes that I would love to have in my collection that have eluded me. I mean, the obvious one, for me is the last shot, which is Michael Jordan's final pair of shoes, which, I mean, I've literally searched for, I mean, I'm a resourceful man. And I've searched for it far and wide. And I mean, there's two pairs out there. And one of them potentially, is that model. But there's also a possibility that Michael Jordan has kept that one himself, which would make sense to me. But it's just not a pair that I've ever been able to acquire. But that would be monumental. And I mean, the closest pair I've seen to that very last pair is actually up at Christie's actually, it's an auction I've held here, the shameless plug, but there is an amazing, low 13 game-worn Michael Jordan sample that's actually on the market as we speak. And that's pretty much as close as I think any of us will get to that last shot ever. And that's, that's an amazing piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you even think to yourself,\u0026nbsp;“I would love to own the last shot piece” or “ the last shot sneaker,” how does that process of even trying to track it down start? Is it all just personal connections? What's that research process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, I mean, my process is I mean, everybody knows I'm an actuary by profession. So my mind is quite analytical, I love a good spreadsheet. I love a good list. So over the years, I've basically built databases of you know, where these assets are, whether it's jerseys, shoes, bats, helmets, you know, not necessarily specific to Michael Jordan, but where big assets are, who owns them, you know, their numbers, their emails, some photos of those assets, the tagging just so I can keep myself fully educated as to you know, the authenticity and what I should be looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do actually have big personal databases that you know, are super valuable to me and help me try to track these things down. And once you get into the circle you know, you do meet insiders, insiders to these athletes, these these these gods so to say, of the world and you can navigate through, there is a there's a way to navigate through that community and figure out how to get out get out assets once you do a deal. Whenever I do deals in the past, it was never you were never buying one item. It wasn't efficient, you were potentially having to get on a plane and travel to Hong Kong or New York and as I said I was based in London in Europe most of the time. So if I was going in, I was going for the kill and I was going to buy as much as I could, you know? And when you get known to be a reliable person who does deals who buys stuff off the medics, the teammates, the ball boys, you know, use that they pass your lap around respectfully and they and you can you know pay the right money for the assets. And at the time it was much simpler like I said they were trying to get rid of assets anonymously without you going to the market. You know, there wasn't really a deep liquid market for them at that point. They also didn't want to be known to be selling the asset that Michael Jordan gave them, so it was much easier. But that's how I go about it and I apply the same technique. Circle still exists, you know, there are other layers, there are more auction houses, there are more dealers, there are more middlemen, but it's just navigating the space. Like any space just like buying a house or a property, it's very similar actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I want to zoom out a little bit. I know, there's probably a lot of people in the audience who are interested in potentially investing in sports memorabilia, and just learning more about the market in general, could you kind of just quickly define for us, what exactly is the sports memorabilia market, and then what makes this category special?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, sports memorabilia market as an asset, if I was thinking about in a real simple kind of definition, any asset that captures an athlete, either his image or a moment, or an event in sports history. And this can be purely a photo on a card, or an actual item used at that point in time or something with a signature from that era. It's a very broad category, so it captures the essence of an athlete.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an interesting category because, I mean, for me, first, take one quick step back to make it clear what the following statement means, to me, it's like an art. These are moments that people have created at the very peak of their career. And if anybody on the call has ever, you know, going down that route of being an athlete or doing a sport, you know, it is extremely difficult to work your way up that ladder to become the top person, just like any artists would have had to work, you know, hundreds of 1000s of hours, you know, to be known as the, you know, the Michelangelo or the Picassos of the world, you know, these athletes have created these moments by being that great. So for me, they aren't just rubber and canvas and suede and leather, and you know, and wood and whatever, whatever materials they use in the equipment. They're actual moments in time that represent something very deep, very hard to achieve, and hence, they are pieces of art, which you which become talking points become storytelling points. And that's how I treat it. So to me, it's art. It's the emotional value. It's the moment, it's a historical moment in time that they capture that they represent, that gives them value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think to your point, the emotional value is so strong, so strong, right? Like we remember those moments that MJ last game shot and different moments. One thing I'm interested in from the investor perspective, is what are some of the factors, the value drivers, of a certain piece of sports memorabilia? I know you mentioned obviously, the moment, like what it's associated with, the athlete. Is there anything else? Can you kind of just elaborate on what some of those important factors are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, those are extremely important facts that you raised. But I think rarity is key, like with any asset. And now the space is becoming much more liquid, and much more, much more educated, people really understand what rarity actually actually means. Now, for me, rarity is literally a handful, you know, and I know there are assets out there. I mean, there is an intersection between demand, and, and supply. And, you know, the perfect example for me is like the card market, the sports card market, there could be 200,000 people who want this one card, and there's only 700 of them, and that seems like a very high demand ratio. And I agree, but actually, ultimate or absolute rarity, where you can have something that like two or three or no other person has, that for me is the ultimate factor. And as we get more educated, we need to know how to filter down to what that rarity actually means. So, in cards, there's, you know, there are populations, there are I mean, you have to think of what is important in the card, what is the emotional value in a card in the card mark is my interpretation. So all the basic stuff about the quality of the card, the centering of the card, you know, the edges of the card, how perfect that card is preserved, those are all very easy parameters to understand. The hard bit is actually delving down to actual rarity and the authenticity and the you know, and the meaning meaningfulness of that card.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think with cards, the excitement usually comes from, say, pulling a card. So being able to calculate and understand the probability of you actually pulling that card that is going to be a big factor in rarity. Which athlete it was related to, that's going to have a big big driver of value and rarity, you know, within each of those athletes, each of those athletes have one or two cards that are the cards to have actually, they probably will have one card is the card. And if it is\u0026nbsp;the card that is in your basic kind of starting point, this is the card I want for Gretzky or for Mantle or for MJ. And then you have to take that particular card and then filter that particular example down into the best version of that example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith game used stuff, it's slightly more complex because once it's far more complex, because it's there's you know, authenticating a card is quite simple, because they are just pieces of paper that capture that nostalgia, authenticating and valuing game used jerseys and shoes is there a lot more intricate details to look at tags and where and you go down this angle of the photo matching, and we'll talk about a bit more about photo matching later on. But after photo matching and understanding signatures, it then gets into this kind of moment, space. And up to that photo matching kind of factor that you're considering, the prices on these things will be kept because it's you know, it's just photo matched. And it could be, you know, just a regular season game, but it's photo match, you know, he wore it. So it's great, it's a great asset, but the price will be capped. The moment it's photo matched, but also the moment that it's photo matched to a huge or significant or turning point, then the price will just shoot up. And that's because it's rarity, meaningfulness, emotional value, and, and that's what these assets, you know, that's why those assets then sort of transition from a sports card or sports item into a piece of art and a piece of history. And I think people are getting far more educated. I mean, there are a lot of sports thinkers, kind of like myself and there's lots of people in the market who\u0026nbsp;try to go out there and kind of give these parameters to people and give that kind of food for thought. So they can think about the value themselves. And it is complicated, but I do really feel that the market is getting very sophisticated. And buyers we're getting very sophisticated and very demanding. And that's right, I think, and I actually support that a lot because it gives us base credibility and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, one thing I think that's so interesting, as I was listening to you speak is that, and I think this is a great point also for our audience. As you know, they continue to learn more about alts. And I'm even on my own journey of learning more about alts. And I think every kind of alts category has its own nuances, you know, when it comes to evaluating an asset. So for instance, you gave the example of sports cards where like the grading and the condition of the card is like a huge determinant. There's different determinants when you look at things like the art market or comic book market. And then obviously, sports memorabilia. Could you just elaborate a bit more? You spoke about photo matching, can we start at the beginning? Like what is even photo matching? Can you kind of just explain that whole process, like what does it even mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eSo photo matching - this will apply to game used stuff firstly, so you photo match game used items. And what that effectively means is that using images and video for when the asset was actually used. You're effectively able to superimpose the asset you have in your hand on top of the image, and every single crease, loose thread game used blemish, production blemish lines up so that it is absolutely conclusive that the asset you have in your head is the exact asset used by Maradonna or by you know, MJ or by David Beckham. And there is zero doubt there. I mean, it's just conclusively matched and attributed to that particular moment. And then if that moment is a big moment, then that's the next stage of kind of research and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Actually, to be honest, and in my opinion, once you've got the photo matched assets, you get so far up the chain. It's the moment that really adds value. You know, and I think, and the uniqueness of that moment moment and, you know, factors that you that the asset has that relate to that moment, you know, for example, I mean, a perfect example of a photo matched asset is something that Public actually have within their portfolio is the Shattered Backboard, Air Jordan 1, which is I mean, I'm obviously biased, because, you know, I was I was involved in that particular transaction some years ago. But that asset has photos of Michael Jordan, taking off his shoes, and giving them to the other athlete. Now, that's just unheard of. And that particular nuance parameter is super important because it not only photo matches the asset to something that MJ would have worn in a big moment, but it also photo matches the backstory and the provenance. So there's, you've conclusively photo matched but also conclusively fact checked, and you have photographic evidence of the backstory and how it actually got from Michael Jordan's feet, to the open market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the fact that Michael Jordan was the person handing the asset over is so significant, because usually, it would go into the admin team or his charity team, or, you know, his, you know, there would be a process because he was such a huge, huge, huge athlete, and he was huge from from day one. I mean, people knew he was a big deal from day one. So to have an asset that comes direct from him, insane. And for me, personally, I mean, if I would have value, it's way up there. It's way up there. I mean, Maradonna’s hand of God, and you know, Kobe's rookie jerseys have absolutely nothing on that particular shoe. But it requires a level of understanding and appreciation of what it actually is, you know?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's so interesting. I'm kind of interested to talk and like, get your opinion on what's happening in the market currently. I know, if we look at the top of the market, we saw in 2021, there was the sale of the 1984, Michael Jordan Airships, which kind of set a record at Sotheby's for over $1.4 million. What have we seen happen from that point? I know you alluded to some other things like sports memorabilia sales, just then the hand of God and different things. What are we kind of seeing in the market right now?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah so what is happening here is that the buyers and investors in these particular assets are extremely educated and they know exactly what they need that asset to have for it to be effectively a one of one, or a really big momentous moment. So the hand of God whatever the 9.3 million for that jersey, it makes absolute sense because it doesn't matter what what you do in life or what your interest in life, you know Diego Maradonna is and we know about that moment, and it's not particularly you know, a positive you know, it is a moment that that has a lot of controversy attached to it. And that just makes it a great asset, which is why that value makes sense. And it shows you the capability of some of these assets. You know, the Kobe Bryant rookie jersey is the one that sold for 3.6 and one that sold for 2.6, 2.7 photo matched rookie moment, rookie Jersey, obviously the passing of Kobe has helped those jerseys as well, rest in peace. But it just shows you that people really know what they want, it has to have every single parameter. If you had a photo of I mean, the Hodges who got the jersey from Maradonna is obviously proof a very good provenance, but there's no photo of Diego Maradonna giving the jersey to him, but it's obviously that the exact jersey because it's photo matched, and it was a very easy photo match and a great photo match. But it was such a unique moment. It was easy, but had Diego Maradonna signed that jersey or if there was an image of him, not being able to really speak English and Hodges saying hey, pointing Give me your jersey if that was documented it would be even more valuable. Similar to the Kobe jerseys, if there were other attributes that made it more unique, and that made the story more clear, the value just goes up, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think what's going on the market is people are really buying meaningful stuff. I mean, I can speak more. I think my knowledge is definitely more expert on the memorabilia side. And as a game used memorabilia side, and I think that's what's happening there. And in my view on the card market, is that people are getting more educated on what actual rarity is. And, you know, I think, game used, and cards, there's definitely a vintage, historic and kind of modern market. As always, with cards, I do just think, by default, the vintage market will always be more valuable. But obviously, as time surpasses, you know, the new market becomes vintage, and it will gradually grow. But there are giants in the sports world, and they've been the same giants for many, many years, even with, you know, Kobe Bryant is a good example. And I think, as I said, that's why I said his passing has added value to those particular jerseys.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the Michael Jordan, rookie jersey, you know, if there was a photo match one it would be significantly more valuable than that. And I think a lot of the collectors in the sports space would agree to that. I know Michael Jordan is still alive, but he's not going to create any more of those moments. I mean, I've seen, I've recently seen an amazing asset, which I can't wait until it comes to the market, but I've seen his playoff, his first playoff rookie shoes. And it's\u0026nbsp;a really great photo match. And if, you know, if a Kobe Jersey sells for $3.6 million, I can see when a shoe like that comes to market or just explode that particular value, because it's such an iconic shoe. And it's his very first playoff and it was used in like two or three of the game. So yeah, I think people want the big pieces, the big investment, the big pieces, this is helping the medium and lower side of the market. But I do think that side of the market will stabilize a bit more, and the value will be very clear to everybody. But yeah, so I think what's going on, I think education is going to be key in terms of estimating the values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, awesome. Okay, cool. I'm going to ask you one more quick question, because I know that we're running over. And I think I think it's such a great point that you make about education. And it's great to hear that, like, as the market is maturing that people, you know, they're getting more educated, they're getting more knowledgeable about these assets. And it's such a great time for the public, for our audience to then kind of come into these categories as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy final question for you was, you spoke about Maradonna, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. These are obviously like Pantheon all time, great athletes, right? When you look at the current kind of crop of athletes who are playing now, are there any that you look at and you think, once they're kind of game used, game worn memorabilia kind of gets out there in the future, it could rival in terms of the sale price? It could kind of rival what we've seen with like, the MJ assets or the Kobe assets or the marathoner assets. Are there any kind of athletes that you look at that will do that?,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah I definitely think they have potential to get up there. This is the will in the basketball world. The Lukas and the Steph Currys, they will get up there. The one thing I will say for the modern athletes, basketball and other sports, is that their game-issued items are much more abundant. So they will be just a much larger supply that also applies to cards as well as a huge supply of modern cards. I do think they can get up there but they literally have to check every single box it would have to be highest scoring game, best playoff run you know you won't really have many multi game worn stuff because of the abundance of the jerseys and stuff for example, but yeah there are definitely are players that will get up there in basketball and football I'm trying to think. Well obviously the Nemars and Mbappes of the world will get up there because there's a direct link there to the Messies and the Ronaldos and the Van Bastens of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think more of what would be the thing to look out for is the gods of the other sports where less focus is currently on at the moment. Those are the ones that will come up I think. I mean, I do honestly think basketball will always be Michael Jordan and then the Kobes and LeBrons and the other greats. Boxing will always be, you know, Mike Tyson. You know, the F1 Racing market will always be Schumacher. You know, Lewis Hamilton and Verstappen will be up there, you know, but everybody's going to want to go back to Schumacher. But I think with education and people understanding all the parameters that they're interested in and getting that real one of one meaningful moment, those will be the athletes we need to look out for that will just jump up there. So not necessarily specifically.. well, obviously, they have to be very good athletes in whatever sport they play, but it will be that one of one, this really unique story that makes them valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eSuper, super insightful.
